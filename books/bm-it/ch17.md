# Chapter 13: **Heavy is the Head That Wears the Crown**

The "Sword of Damocles" is a 4th century B.C. parable, popularized by Cicero, about a courtier named Damocles and his ruler, Dionysius II of Syracuse. In the story, Damocles tells Dionysius how fortunate Dionysius must feel to be the ruler, since he has all the power and is surrounded by wealth. Dionysius, annoyed at the flattery, offers to let Damocles sit on a throne and experience being surrounded by servitude and opulence for a day. Damocles happily accepts and gets treated to a day of luxury, with servants catering to his every whim.

However, the catch is that while Damocles sits on the mock throne, a sword hangs by a single thread with the point facing down over his head. The sword over Damocles represents the fact that Dionysius, who ruled with an iron fist to achieve and maintain his power and wealth, and therefore made many enemies along the way, is constantly worried about assassination or other threats. To paraphrase Shakespeare, "heavy is the head that wears the crown." This is what Dionysius wanted to show Damocles. Being the ruler comes with perks, but also comes with great costs compared to those of a simpler life. Once Damocles noticed the sword hanging over him, he felt constantly in danger, could no longer enjoy the luxury of his situation, and begged to end the ordeal.[^181]

As the prior chapter discussed, the current global financial system pushes volatility toward developing nations. The United States sits at the core of the system as the issuer of the world reserve currency that most other currency ledgers in various ways attach themselves to. However, while the United States has indeed benefited tremendously from this arrangement, it comes with a great cost.

The cost of the 1944--1971 Bretton Woods system was that it drained the U.S. of its gold reserves over time, until it led to default on the promise of gold redeemability. It was poorly designed from the start, with a finite amount of gold but an endlessly reproducible number of dollars that were redeemable to foreign creditors for gold, and therefore it inevitably broke down over time.

The cost of the Eurodollar/Petrodollar system, from 1974 to the present, is that by having so many entities around the world hold dollar-denominated assets for lack of a better alternative, it artificially increases the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. The extra monetary premium reduces the United States' export competitiveness and gradually hollows outs the United States' industrial base. To supply the world with the dollars it needs, the United States runs a persistent trade deficit. The very power granted to the reserve currency issuer is also what, over the course of decades, begins to poison it and render it unfit to maintain its status.

To understand how the current Eurodollar/Petrodollar system harms the United States' export competitiveness, we can define four macroeconomic terms: a trade balance, a current account balance, a capital account balance, and a net international investment position.

*Trade Balance*: A country's trade balance measures the value of goods and services it exports minus the value of goods and services that it imports. A country that exports more than it imports (i.e., produces more than it consumes) has a trade surplus. A country that imports more than it exports (i.e., consumes more than it produces) has a trade deficit.

*Current Account Balance*: The current account balance is a broader measure that includes the trade balance, plus investment income between nations, plus cash transfers. A country with a current account surplus has more value flowing into it. A country with a current account deficit has more value flowing out of it.

*Capital Account Balance*: The capital account balance is the opposite side of a current account balance. It represents the change in ownership of assets. A country with a current account deficit ends up with a capital account surplus of the same amount, which means foreigners are owning more and more of the country's capital assets. A country that runs a current account surplus ends up with a capital account deficit of the same amount, which means that they are owning more and more foreign assets.

*Net International Investment Position (NIIP)*: Private citizens and government organizations of a country may own capital assets of other countries, like real estate, shares of corporations, bonds, and so forth. A country's net international investment position represents the accumulation of current account and capital account imbalances. It quantifies the total amount of foreign assets that a country's citizens and government own minus the total amount of domestic assets that foreign citizens and governments own.

Countries that produce more than they consume over a long period of time generate trade surpluses and current account surpluses. This results in a positive net international investment position. In other words, they end up owning a lot of foreign assets including other countries' gold, other countries' real estate, other countries' bonds, and other countries' business equity, plus any income streams that these assets may provide.

Conversely, countries that produce less than they consume over a long period of time generate trade deficits and current account deficits. This results in a negative net international position. This means that people and institutions in foreign countries end up owning more of these countries' gold, real estate, bonds, and business equity, and thus people within the country lose the value of the income streams that these assets may provide.

**Correcting a Balance of Payments Problem**

When a country runs a large and persistent trade deficit due to a mismatch in consumption and production, it means that value is flowing out of the country. The country is, in essence, living above its means. At the same time, to pay for this imbalance in consumption, various domestic entities (including individuals, companies, and/or the government), are giving up ownership in valuable capital assets to the foreign entities (including individuals, companies, or governments) that they are becoming indebted to.

A simple way to envision this at first is with a very basic gold-backed monetary system example without credit. We start with two countries, Japan and Brazil, a century ago. Brazil exports a lot of commodities, while Japan lacks sufficient domestic commodities but exports a lot of precision industrial goods. They start with a clean slate; no Japanese investors own any Brazilian assets, and no Brazilian investors own any Japanese assets. In this hypothetical example, they establish a trade connection, and Japan happens to export more goods and services to Brazil than Brazil exports to Japan, and all transactions are paid for with gold coins or bars. So, Japan runs a trade surplus with Brazil. If Brazil is paying for the goods and services with gold, it means that gold is flowing out of Brazil and into Japan, in exchange for more goods and services flowing into Brazil from Japan. Brazil is accumulating goods and services that depreciate in their value over time, while Japan is accumulating Brazil's gold, which lasts forever and represents savings. There could, however, be a time in the future where Japan begins importing more than it exports. For example, if commodities become globally undersupplied and expensive at some point in the future, then Japan as a resource-limited country could end up paying a lot more money for its commodity imports, and therefore could benefit from having a lot of gold savings from its prior productive period of running trade surpluses. Brazil, as a nation that exports commodities, might therefore be able to get a lot of that gold back during a period of high commodity prices.

We can then expand this into a more realistic and modern example, with credit and capital ownership. If Japan and Brazil are doing a lot of trading, it could be with a variety of different monies, such as their own fiat currencies, or U.S. dollars, or debt and equity arrangements. For example, maybe Brazil pays for its Japanese imports with Brazilian currency (which are liabilities of Brazil's central bank), and those Japanese producers take the Brazilian currency and immediately buy Brazilian assets with it, such as Brazilian stocks or real estate, or Brazilian government bonds. Instead of losing its gold to Japan in this scenario, Brazil is instead losing some of its ownership of domestic real estate and companies. Japan is acquiring a larger and larger stake in Brazilian real estate and companies, either as an equity holder or as a credit lender. Brazilian entities in aggregate are overconsuming and are paying for current consumption out of their future expected income streams. Japanese entities in aggregate are allowing Brazilian entities to overconsume, and in the process are acquiring a larger and larger share of the future income streams of various Brazilian companies and real estate. Alternatively, Japanese producers could take the Brazilian currency that they earn, sell it for gold or U.S. dollars, and accumulate those instead; their contracts are likely denominated in U.S. dollars anyway. If they do this, it will weaken Brazil's currency, and thus weaken the ability of Brazilians to buy imports.

Temporary trade deficits are fine, and inevitable. To continue with our example, perhaps in the early years of this trade relationship, Brazil imports many technical products from Japan to build railways and shipping ports, as well as advanced mining and farming equipment, and therefore runs a temporary trade deficit. Brazil gives some of its gold and capital stock to Japan in the process. However, Brazil uses these imports very productively, and with new railways and shipping ports and equipment, it can double its annual commodity exports to the world and start running a trade surplus. It can then accumulate foreign assets over time, such as gold or stakes in foreign capital assets with their associated income streams. This would be an example of productive specialization and trade: Japanese companies have considerable expertise in industrial production and infrastructure but have limited commodity resources, while Brazil has vast commodity deposits and production capabilities that could be enhanced by importing those Japanese goods and services and putting them to good use to unlock some of that value. Brazilian leadership might also use this opportunity to invest in education, so that their own citizens can move up the value ladder and start creating more complex products and services in addition to their commodity exports.

Long-term trade deficits, on the other hand, are usually a problem. If Brazilian entities in the early years of this trade relationship with Japan are just racking up debt, giving away their equity, becoming renters rather than owners, shipping away their gold, and not using the imports to build their own production capabilities, then they are becoming impoverished due to some combination of overconsumption and underproduction. They may also have some of the value siphoned off by corrupt rulers, or by bad terms with multinational corporations in what are basically neocolonialist trade relationships. In this case, well-connected insiders at the top are likely to make a lot of income and put it into offshore bank accounts and other foreign assets, while the population suffers.

After a while, a trade imbalance such as this tends to resolve itself. It could be that the country that is running a persistent deficit (Brazil in this example) realizes the problem, takes corrective action, and begins a series of policy reforms to become more productive. Alternatively, it could be a less pleasant outcome: The country that runs the persistent deficit becomes increasingly impoverished and unable to keep consuming foreign goods and services at the rate that it used to. It loses its gold, it loses a lot of its own domestic equity stakes, its currency weakens, and/or it becomes greatly indebted. They buy fewer imports from foreign countries out of necessity since they lack savings and have bad credit ratings. After that, being rather impoverished now, they are more willing to work for lower wages and their production could therefore start to become more globally competitive. It's a painful cycle, but as long as they don't fall into complete sociopolitical disarray, this reduction in import power and uptick in export competitiveness creates a new opportunity to establish a period of overproduction and underconsumption, which can bring wealth back into the country.

In many cases, a country's current account balance gets expressed through its currency. The fiat currency of a country represents the ability to buy that country's goods, services, and assets. Therefore, a highly productive country's fiat currency tends to strengthen over time relative to the fiat currencies of unproductive countries, since value is continuously flowing into that country's economy and ledger system. Their wages tend to rise, and the quality of life tends to increase. Their ability to import things from other countries therefore increases as well.

Significant imbalances can arise, however, if a country makes its fiat currency artificially strong or weak. Mercantilism, for example, is an economic policy that seeks to maximize exports and minimize imports. Mercantilist political leaders of an export-driven country might, for example, continuously debase their currency to keep real wages in their country low, rather than let the currency rise naturally. This keeps their people from spending much on imports, keeps their labor pay rates globally competitive (i.e., very low), and allows the country to persistently bring in more value than it otherwise would. However, that value tends to consolidate near the top of the socioeconomic ladder and into government hands. Mercantilist countries tend to build large industrial centers and accumulate a lot of foreign reserves, while their laborers see their savings and purchasing power continually drained away from them.

On the other side of mercantilism, is what happens to a country whose fiat currency is used as a world reserve currency. The United States has engineered the global monetary system in such a way that there is vast demand for dollars from places around the world. In addition to dollars representing the ability to buy American goods, services, and assets, dollars can be used to buy almost anything globally, including commodities from around the world. During the mid-/late 20th century and early 21st century, the dollar has been the fiat currency of the most powerful country, both economically and militarily. Japanese entities don't want to hold a lot of Brazilian currency. Brazilian entities don\'t want to hold a lot of Japanese currency either. But both Brazilian and Japanese entities want to hold a lot of dollars. Some of this is natural demand, and some of this is because they want to be in good relations with the United States and holding plenty of U.S. Treasuries as reserves is a step in the right direction for that. Meanwhile, many countries like Saudi Arabia only price their oil in dollars, no matter who they are selling it to, due to historical arrangements with the United States and its military protection. Many nations want to hold some dollar-denominated assets to ensure that they can sell them to buy oil and other international goods if needed.

This sounds great for Americans at first. Our currency is unusually strong since it is more widely held globally than other fiat currencies and therefore has an extra monetary premium. Entities from countries all around the world hold dollars and dollar-denominated assets like Treasuries and equities. However, this extra currency strength greatly increases American import power and reduces American export competitiveness. It becomes expensive to pay American workers compared to workers in other countries, including both developed and developing countries. A structural trade deficit develops, and never seems to be resolved, decade after decade. Over time, more manufacturing facilities leave the United States and head to places like Germany, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Mexico. Workers in the United States generally cease to build expertise in manufacturing compared to their counterparts in more industrially competitive countries.

In the late 19th century and well into the 20th century, the United States was the up-and-coming industrial powerhouse with a structural trade surplus. The United Kingdom issued the world reserve currency, and ran a structural trade deficit. In the second half of the 20th century, the United States took over as the issuer of the world reserve currency and began experiencing a structural trade deficit, while Saudi Arabia, Germany, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Switzerland, China, and other countries arose as the countries with major trade surpluses.[^182]

The Eurodollar/Petrodollar system extends the reach of the United States in many ways, including its ability to maintain hundreds of foreign military bases, but it hollows out the domestic industrial base. For most countries, the value of their currency reflects their current account balance over time, but the United States can maintain a current account deficit for decades upon decades and just keep hollowing itself out due to that extra layer of global demand for its currency.

In this sense, the United States doesn't have the natural response functions that other countries have when trade deficits persist for too long. Instead, the problem is allowed to get worse than normal, for longer than normal. The United States is like a boxer that doesn't feel pain; he's still accumulating damage but doesn't feel it, and thus by the time he *does* feel it, he'll have accumulated a lot more damage than he realized. "Damage" in this context is a deeply negative net international investment position and a hollowed-out domestic industrial base --- along with a very angry working class.[^183] These types of multi-decade, excessive trade deficits were part of what Keynes was trying to avoid with his proposed bancor-based system, but because that complicated system was avoided in favor of the Bretton Woods system and later the Eurodollar/Petrodollar system, we built up these major trade imbalances.

Starting in the 1970s and 1980s as shown in Figure 13-A, the United States began running a structural trade deficit.

Figure 13-A[^184]

Starting in the mid-1980s as shown in Figure 13-B, the United States dipped into a negative net international investment position, which meant that foreigners owned more American assets (stocks, bonds, and real estate) than Americans owned of foreign assets for the first time. By the 2010s, the American net international investment position became deeply negative.

By the beginning of the 2000s decade, U.S. industrial production had practically peaked, and has trended mostly sideways ever since. As shown on Figure 13-C, on a per capita basis, U.S. industrial production has been trending down during this sideways period, after eight decades of trending upwards.

Macroeconomic analyst Luke Gromen has made the argument that the Eurodollar/Petrodollar system most likely played a significant role in the United States' victory in the Cold War. Getting several oil-exporting nations to exclusively use dollars for their oil exports helped to box in the Soviet Union economically and geographically throughout the 1980s. The Soviets had to exchange real value for their oil production and other commodity procurements, while the United States could print money for it and defer the costs. However, Gromen argues that by the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States should have attempted to re-arrange this system to clear trade imbalances more regularly, rather than try to keep the system in place as they have.[^187] Since the 1990s, the Eurodollar/Petrodollar system has been more of a curse than a blessing, since it allows mercantilist nations to run increasingly large trade surpluses with the United States and hollow out its industrial competitiveness, which by extension leads to a reduction in military competitiveness in the very long run.

The people who benefit from this system are twofold. The first group of beneficiaries consists of American financiers and the establishment class more broadly. Americans who work in finance, government, defense, technology, healthcare, and other monopoly or high-margin non-industrial businesses benefit greatly from this system, because they get all the benefits of increased consumption and global dominion without the drawbacks of less export competitiveness. The second group of beneficiaries consists of foreign exporters and industrialists and their leaders. Chinese manufacturers, for example, have been able to build massive wealth from this imbalance.

The people who are harmed by this system are also twofold. The first group consists of American workers. Working-class Americans who make physical products have been harmed by this system in aggregate, because the wages to hire Americans are high in global terms and their exports are expensive in global terms, even compared to exporters in other developed countries. As a result, a lot of this manufacturing capacity initially flowed to Germany and Japan and then flowed toward China and other developing nations.[^188] The second group consists of consumers in developing mercantilist nations, or nations that otherwise fail to have their currencies accrue value. People around the world, especially in developing countries, hold money in their local currencies that get frequently devalued over time. This is either because current account surpluses are converted into sovereign reserves held by the country's central planners, or because the country fails to accrue a current account surplus and faces constant currency dilution.

It\'s not so much that a strong or weak currency is inherently good or bad per se, but rather that an *artificially* strong or weak currency relative to a country's trade balance is bad. If a country has a persistent trade surplus but constantly weakens its otherwise-appreciating currency by accumulating central bank reserves (mercantilism), then value is siphoned away from workers and toward the leaders. Similarly, if a country has a persistent trade deficit but has an extra monetary premium built onto its otherwise-depreciating currency due to its imperial prowess, then its workers are not very competitive in terms of global labor rates and will likely stagnate, while their political leaders, multinational corporations, and wealthy elite will thrive.

The past fifty years can be described as a period of dominion for United States' elites, which came at the expense of liberty and domestic economic vibrancy for the majority. "United States, the Empire" grew while "United States, the Country" stagnated, and this was largely a bipartisan phenomenon. As a result, we have hundreds of foreign military bases while our domestic infrastructure is aging. We can win practically any naval battle, while we fall behind the rest of the developed world in terms of education. We actively engage with China in a great power competition, while relying heavily on importing Chinese-made goods to finance our consumption.

Much like the Roman Empire eventually found itself with borders so big that it couldn't protect them all, the United States currently finds itself stretched so thin and trying to maintain a financial system and geopolitical structure that it no longer truly benefits from. The boxer hasn't felt pain for a while; he took a lot of punches and is just now starting to feel the damage he took throughout this time. Those near the top have benefited for decades, while those at the bottom have not, and the industrial base and net international investment position of the country have been hollowed out because of it.

The U.S. political establishment could pivot and start to proactively fix this. We could pull back gracefully from the rest of the world, reduce military spending, improve our monetary system, invest domestically, and emphasize "United States, the Country" rather than "United States, the Empire." Other nations would have to step up in terms of their own defense spending, and the world would be more multipolar in general, with separate spheres of influence. In terms of this topic, anthropologist and business executive Natalie Smolenski has described the importance of having a positive political project to focus on. In other words, the mission wouldn't be about stagnating and pulling back (which is hard for the citizenry to rally around and feel good about), but rather the mission would be about re-prioritizing our efforts domestically and building something new and fresh here at home.[^189]

Unfortunately, most empires, once they reach their apex, don't pull back gracefully and positively. They expend resources to try to fight and keep every inch of what they have, while factions inside the empire battle each other, and while external forces chip away at the borders.[^190] Large organizations in general, including both governments and corporations, rarely disrupt themselves. Institutional inertia exists, meaning once things are set on a path, they tend to remain on that path even when it no longer makes sense, until they are heavily disrupted. Empires usually end up pivoting late from a position of weakness, rather than pivoting early from a position of strength.

Many Americans assume that part of maintaining quality of life in the country means that we should do whatever we can to maintain the status quo situation of the dollar as the world reserve currency. However, I view it differently. The status quo of the dollar's hegemony has directly contributed to the domestic hollowing-out that we've experienced for decades --- especially after the Cold War ended. The system that has been in place since the 1970s is antiquated monetary technology and is inherently unsustainable due to the accrued imbalances that it creates. Losing dollar hegemony at this point would harm special interests in the United States, would reduce the country's imperial reach, and would require a shift of priorities, but ultimately it would lead toward a more natural and balanced global economy and provide the opportunity for U.S. domestic revitalization. The risk comes when we fail to recognize that and thus fail to make proactive changes from a position of strength. And so far, that's the path we\'ve chosen.

**The Failed War on Terror**

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the United States responded with war. The military efforts initially focused on Afghanistan where the attack's organizer Osama Bin Laden and his allies were hiding, but then expanded into Iraq as well --- even though Iraq was not involved in the terrorist attacks and doesn't even share a border with Afghanistan. Most Americans couldn't locate either country on a map, conceptually mixed them together, and went along with the messaging of the government and the corporate media at the time about the "War on Terror." At the peak level of support in 2003, Gallup polls showed that 76% of Americans supported going to war against Iraq.[^191] For an American to express disapproval regarding the war against Iraq was considered very unpatriotic to many people at the time.

Wars that are financed with debt denominated in fiat currency units that the central bank can print, are not transparently priced. If the war against Iraq came with a 10% special war income tax for all Americans, the level of public support would have surely been lower. If we had to pay for it transparently in real time, then maybe we would think twice and look more deeply into the matter before blindly committing to it. On the other hand, if the costs of war seem trivial or unclear to us, if we barely know the difference between Afghanistan and Iraq, and can't locate either on the map, and the political leaders and media are saying it's a good and patriotic idea and that it's necessary for national security, then why not go to war?

The Watson Institute for International & Public Affairs at Brown University initiated a Costs of War project in 2010 with dozens of scholars that analyzed the full costs of the total War on Terror (Afghanistan, Iraq, and related efforts), which at that point was still ongoing. They continue to update the project to this day, since the costs continue to pile up even now that the war is over. As of fiscal year 2022, they estimated the total cost of the war so far to be approximately \$5.8 trillion. This includes over \$2.1 trillion in direct war funding, another \$2.1 trillion for the expansion of the baseline military expenditures and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, nearly half a trillion for cumulative veteran\'s benefits, and \$1.1 trillion in interest on the debt used to pay for it. Going forward, they expect another \$2.2 trillion in estimated veterans' care over the next three decades that has been committed to, and they calculate that the cumulative debt interest on this is likely to be another \$5+ trillion during that period.[^192] Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of foreign civilians are estimated to have been killed in combat zones, and millions of people have been displaced.

When 76% of Americans supported the Iraq war, did they do so with the understanding that it would have a \$5.8 trillion cumulative price tag on the public by 2022, and perhaps a \$13+ trillion price tag by 2050? The answer of course is no, because the issuance of fiat currency debt, and the currency dilution associated with the monetization of that debt, rendered it almost entirely opaque. People pay for the war over time in ways they can't detect. It can also be thought of as having been paid through opportunity costs; what if the government had instead spent this tremendous amount of value on domestic infrastructure, math and science education, foreign aid to strengthen global alliances, or by giving every American a big tax cut and letting them keep more of their own money?

Decades later, as I write this, the United States faces large fiscal deficits in part due to all of this accumulated interest that we owe on the debt, partly from the failed war. Some politicians are in favor of raising taxes, which along with inflation is a way of paying for the war in hindsight by the next generation, which didn't initiate the war in the first place.

In a 2017 testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Linda J. Bilmes of Harvard University described the opaque financing of the war as follows:

> The wartime budgetary process for the post-9/11 wars from 2001 to 2017 is the largest single deviation from standard budgetary practice in U.S. history.
>
> In every previous extended US conflict --- including the War of 1812, the Spanish-American War, Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam --- we increased taxes and cut non-war spending. We raised taxes on the wealthy.
>
> President Truman raised the top marginal tax rate to 92% during Korea. He believed it was morally right to "pay-as-you-go" --- a term he coined and repeated in more than 200 speeches. President Johnson was more reluctant, but in 1967 he imposed a Vietnam War surcharge that raised top tax rates to 77%.
>
> By contrast, in 2001 and 2003, Congress cut taxes --- the "Bush tax cuts" as we went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since then, we have paid for these wars by piling up debt on the national credit card. No previous U.S. war was financed entirely through debt. I refer to these wars as the "Credit Card Wars."
>
> In addition, we have budgeted for these wars differently. In every previous major war, the war budget was integrated into the regular defense budget after the initial period. This meant that Congress and the Pentagon had to make trade-offs within the defense budget.
>
> By contrast, the post-9/11 wars have been funded mostly by supplemental appropriations. The post-9/11 wars have been funded through emergency and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) bills, which are exempt from spending caps and do not require offsetting cuts anywhere elsewhere in the budget. Over 90% of direct war spending for the current wars has been paid through supplemental money compared to 35% for Korea and 32% for Vietnam.
>
> This process is less transparent, less accountable, and has rendered the cost of the wars far less visible.[^193]

Over two decades since the War on Terror began, it's clear by almost every objective analysis that this was a failed war, and failed wars are what put empires at risk. While those involved in the terrorist attacks needed to be sought and held accountable, and future attempts at terrorist attacks needed to be mitigated to reasonable degrees, the spread of the war into Iraq was an expensive distraction and the United States did not gain trillions of dollars of value by engaging in it.

Much like World War I, most of this military engagement didn't need to happen, and mainly happened anyway due to the availability of money printers and opaque financing by a small number of people in seats of imperial power, so that the costs could be abstracted away from the public. The public pays for it over time by currency debasement, or through higher taxes that are imposed decades later to rein in deficit-driven inflation caused by these prior decisions that led to so much debt and cumulative interest expenses. The biggest beneficiaries of the war were the U.S. corporations that make products for the military.

**How China Subverted the Current System**

During the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s decades, trade partners that ran large trade surpluses with the United States generally reinvested those dollars back into U.S. assets ---especially U.S. Treasuries. This made the U.S. federal government increasingly indebted to foreign nations, but also allowed them to run significant fiscal deficits while keeping their currency strong.

Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries would sell a lot of oil to the United States and store those dollar trade surpluses in U.S. Treasuries. Germany and Japan would sell a lot of cars to the United States and store those dollar trade surpluses in U.S. Treasuries. China, Taiwan, and Singapore would sell a lot of electronics to the United States and store those dollar trade surpluses in U.S. Treasuries. Over time, many of these foreign creditors began diversifying into owning U.S. stocks, U.S. real estate, and U.S. private equity. They increasingly owned stakes in U.S. capital assets; Americans were selling away larger and larger parts of their future income streams, through debt and equity, to fuel their ongoing consumption of Chinese-made, depreciating assets.

After the 2008 global financial crisis, interest rates on U.S. Treasuries became very low for a decade, frequently below the rate of price inflation. It was not very desirable to hold them anymore. Any country that holds dollars or Treasuries as its reserve assets at a time when interest rates are below the rate of inflation, is basically paying financial tribute to the United States and devaluing their own savings. Starting in 2013, China did something that other trade partners hadn't done before within the context of the Eurodollar/Petrodollar system: They declared that it was no longer in their best interest to keep accumulating U.S. Treasuries, and instead they launched the Belt and Road Initiative. For this initiative, they began taking their dollar trade surpluses and investing them into approximately 150 countries throughout the world, with an emphasis on infrastructure and commodity production. They made dollar-denominated loans for countries all around the world to build infrastructure, especially trade-based infrastructure (roads, railways, ports, refineries, and commodity deposits). China would get financial returns from these investments or would get rights to their use and production. In other words, China in the 21st century began doing the same sort of neocolonialist financial arrangements that American and European countries did throughout the 20th century.[^194]

While I am no fan of China's human rights record or authoritarian form of government, it was clear why they wanted to do this. Britain and France treated China terribly in the 19th century during the Opium Wars, when they literally went to war with China to force opium into the country and to force China to sign unequal trade agreements. This initiated what China refers to as the "century of humiliation" where they were weakened considerably by European powers, and then later invaded by Japan and subjected to myriad war crimes. Then, throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the United States and European countries engaged in monetary neocolonialism throughout the developed world. With a handful of notable exceptions (mostly in Asia), emerging markets rarely ever actually "emerge" within this system. Instead, they tend to remain shackled in foreign currency debt, running on an economic treadmill to send exports to the United States and Europe without accruing durable capital themselves. Chinese leaders see themselves as trying to break out of this system to re-establish their country as a fully sovereign global power that doesn't rely on the U.S. dollar. The same is generally true for India, Brazil, and other large developing countries.

Meanwhile, the United States finds itself with a hollowed-out industrial base and is using its unrivaled navy to protect the global shipping lanes for what is increasingly (and ironically) Chinese-dominated trade. China has larger electricity production than the United States, more skyscrapers, a larger industrial base, more commodity consumption, more manufacturing output, and is the biggest trading partner with most countries in the world now, having replaced the United States in that regard. The United States, meanwhile, continues to run large trade deficits and dig deeper and deeper into a negative net international investment position. As a result, tensions are growing between the United States and China, since the United States isn't benefiting from being the world reserve currency issuer in the way that it used to but still isn\'t willing to take steps to change that. Increasingly, the United States is having to finance its own fiscal deficits, as much of the world slows down or ceases their accumulation of U.S. Treasuries.

**Moving Toward a Multipolar World**

Much like how the Bretton Woods system eventually became untenable by drawing down U.S. gold reserves, the Eurodollar/Petrodollar system is becoming untenable by hollowing out the U.S. industrial base and U.S. net international investment position. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

When the Bretton Woods system was created, the United States had over 40% of global GDP, by far the largest industrial base, the best geography/agriculture situation, the dominant navy, the largest gold reserves, and a positive net international investment position. Over time, U.S. GDP dropped to 20-25% of global GDP on a nominal basis --- or as low as 15% on a purchasing power basis --- and with a deeply negative net international investment position after continuously running trade deficits for decades. Meanwhile, we lost the role as the world's largest trading partner. The main things we have left are the best geography and agriculture capacity, a robust startup ecosystem, and a dominant navy. Those aren't necessarily enough when trying to remain in a seat of global power.

However, it's not as though the Eurozone or China can replace the United States as the issuer of a dominant world reserve currency. Neither of those currency blocs have 40% of global GDP, like the United States once had. The Eurozone has a monetary union without a fiscal union, insufficient energy security, and top-heavy demographics. China also has top-heavy demographics, weaker geography in terms of coasts and rivers and safe borders, weaker rule of law, and shallower capital markets, which renders it inherently unfit to play the role that the United States was able to play in the mid-20th century. As a result, the world's economy is naturally a lot more spread out now, rather than heavily concentrated in just one country. The United States, China, India, Japan, Brazil, Russia, and several European countries all have considerable economic power regionally, with certain strengths and weaknesses.

Many people think that the world must have a world reserve currency. They think that much like how the world reserve currency went from the U.K. pound sterling to the U.S. dollar, it will go next to the Chinese yuan. Other analysts think that because the Chinese yuan isn't good enough, there is no alternative other than for it to stay with the U.S. dollar for the foreseeable future.[^195] However, I consider both of those scenarios to be a misreading of history. The 19th and 20th centuries were anomalies. The world is instead shifting toward a multipolar, neutral reserve currency system, rather than a system where one country issues far-and-away the most dominant world reserve currency. No country, whether the United States or China or anyone else, is big enough to issue a fiat currency that the whole world can use and would want to use. The only thing that can be big enough is a form of supranational money; one that has natural scarcity and is not issued by a government.

From the mid-19th century until the 1960s, global holdings of gold by central banks (sovereign gold reserves) structurally increased from next to nothing to approximately 38,000 tons. From there, central bank holdings of gold all around the world began to gradually shrink down to under 30,000 tons while central bank holdings of U.S. dollars grew continuously. However, ever since the 2008 global financial crisis, foreign central banks began consistently accumulating gold again, and are now back over 35,000 tons. Starting in the mid-2010s decade, foreign central banks stopped accumulating dollar-denominated reserves in aggregate. Around the margins, countries are increasing their yuan holdings, but from a small base. Rather than primarily accumulating dollars, the central banks of developing countries are diversifying into several currencies, and they are accumulating gold.

This diversification becomes increasingly relevant in a world of conflict and war. The United States can sanction any country as long as that country primarily uses dollar-denominated payment rails or accumulates its reserves in dollar-denominated assets. Russia, partially anticipating this, focused for the past decade on accumulating gold reserves and reducing its dollar reserves. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, U.S. and European authorities froze Russian reserves (which by that point were mostly in euros; Russia didn't seem to anticipate that even their euro assets would be frozen). Russia then accelerated its goals to sell its oil, gas, and other commodities to China in Chinese yuan. Several other countries have been diversifying their payment and savings methods in a similar way.

Why would Saudi Arabia continue to indefinitely price its oil only in U.S. dollars, and aggressively accumulate U.S. Treasuries, when its largest trading partner now is China? And what if the United States one day decides to freeze Saudi Arabia's reserves? Why would China, as the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods, hold its reserves primarily in U.S. dollars? And why would India do this?

If a country holds most of its reserves in another country's fiat currency, then they are not fully sovereign since their savings can be frozen by that country. Physical banknotes can't be frozen, but holding large amounts of banknotes is mostly untenable since unlike securities, banknotes don't earn interest to offset some of the inflation. So, reserves are normally held as deposits or securities that pay interest, and thus are freezable by the controllers of that nation's ledger. Powerful countries all around the world are seeking to gradually diversify their reserves, use gold as reserves, and/or build alternative payment rails that don't rely on U.S. dollars or go through New York financial institutions. This allows them, as sovereign nations, to save on their terms and pay on their terms, in a global economic environment.

It remains to be seen what the next global financial system will look like, but it's clear that much like the 1860s, the 1940s, and the 1970s, the system is going through a period of structural change in the 2020s.

In recent years, a handful of major currencies such as the Chinese yuan have been able to buy oil and gas and other commodities as well. The dollar remains by far the most-commonly used currency for trade, but its share is slightly drifting lower. Countries have been gradually diversifying their reserve practices and payment systems. Figure 13-E shows a simplified example of a multipolar reserve currency system in the same format as the diagrams from Chapter 11.

If international agreements create supranational currencies that participants hold in reserves (like the bancor concept to varying degrees), or if assets like gold or bitcoin are held in reserve and used as settlement assets to buy international goods, then the system would resemble Figure 13-F.
