# Chapter 17: **The Financialization of Everything**

When money in a society maintains its value well over time, there is an incentive to hold wealth in it. Savers will likely be prudent when deciding how much money to place into investments, since investments represent a higher-reward and higher-risk option compared to the default situation of holding reliable sound money.

On the other hand, when money in a society keeps degrading in value, there is a strong incentive to hold other things that have greater scarcity, and thus to add a monetary premium to those other things above and beyond the utility value of those things.

If something like gold is money, then the common form of money is rather sound and there is less reason for investors to have second and third homes, large stock portfolios, and an assortment of collectibles. Of course, some people will have those things, but they will be more discretionarily and thoughtfully collected, and are likely to represent a smaller share of an investor's net worth. However, in weak money environments where supply of money keeps growing and interest rates are below the prevailing inflation rate, then there is a strong incentive to avoid cash and instead to hold second or third homes, to buy stocks, and to own a large assortment of collectibles at inflated valuations. In the absence of good money, everything else that has some degree of scarcity gets monetized instead.[^253] There's also a big incentive to borrow (i.e., to "short") money and use it to buy these scarcer things, which drives up leverage in the system.

This can be a particular problem when things of utility get monetized to problematic levels. For the most part, it's fine if something like gold has a huge monetary premium above its utility value. This is because most of its demand is for jewelry and savings, and its industrial use-cases can often be substituted with other materials when necessary. If gold were to double in price next year, most people in society wouldn't have any noticeable negative impact on their life. But if houses get monetized and left empty for most of the year due to wealthy investors and upper-middle class investors buying extra ones with cheap credit, then it can crowd out the middle class and working class from having access to affordable shelter. This problem shows up in the ratio of home prices to incomes, and has become especially problematic in desirable cities and tourist destinations. Such high prices make it virtually impossible to afford the housing without very high usage of debt financing.

This problem is further amplified by global capital flight. Many wealthy Chinese citizens, for example, don't want to hold all their money in China, because there it's easy to confiscate and control. Over the past couple decades, wealthy Chinese citizens have had a strong tendency to buy real estate in Australia, Canada, and southeast Asia, and thus contribute to extraordinarily high housing prices in those regions. Not only were property values inflated from artificially low interest rates and debt accumulation by domestic buyers, but it was made even worse by this extra foreign demand.

The monetization of utility assets can also be seen when comparing equity valuations or household net worth ratios to interest rates. Normally, business equity is valued based on an assessment of its likely future cash flows. When interest rates are high, and well above the inflation rate, then equity valuations tend to be low and more closely aligned with their future expected cash flows, with most of their monetary premium removed. When interest rates are below the inflation rate, and low in general, people would rather hold almost anything else than cash, whether it be equities, real estate, or collectibles even at inflated valuations. These things acquire a monetary premium, in other words.

People generally build their retirement savings accounts out of equities, rather than money. Therefore, equities of large publicly traded companies acquire a monetary premium compared to most private businesses. This gives large corporations a lower cost of equity capital, and thus gives them a structural advantage (among many other advantages) over smaller, private businesses.

Unusually high equity valuations can further distort capital formation and resource usage. Perpetually unprofitable, growth-oriented companies can exist for longer periods of time in their state of unprofitability, as people prefer to hold their equity, rather than to hold cash that fails to maintain its purchasing power. These companies can underprice their products and services, operate at a perpetual loss, and finance themselves by continually issuing new shares to employees as compensation and continually issuing new shares for investors to buy. The company then grows faster than normal market pricing would allow, due to these high-valuation monetized shares and persistently unprofitable prices for its goods and services. When this goes on for many years or even decades, it becomes challenging to determine what the true market values of their products and services are, since they are priced below their cost of production. This type of company, in an era of soft money, sucks in capital from investors that could otherwise be going to things with clearer pricing mechanisms, and thus can eventually lead to a period of supply shortages and price inflation elsewhere in the economy.

If, or *when*, a harder money environment returns --- such as due to higher interest rates from the central bank trying to reduce price inflation --- then investors realize that these perpetually unprofitable companies have been partial malinvestments all along. When money gets harder, fewer people are willing to pay up for the stock at such high valuations, and so the stock valuation falls. This makes it impossible for the company to keep raising capital to operate in its structurally unprofitable way. It then must raise prices and cut expenses to become profitable, but by doing so they slow down their growth rate, because part of their growth only existed in the first place by having underpriced their products or services relative to what it cost to produce them. And with that slower and more honest growth rate comes an even lower equity valuation, and thus the vicious cycle continues until most of the malinvestments are wiped out. It's not necessarily that the product or service shouldn't exist, but that it was priced incorrectly by users and investors for a prolonged period, and its real supply-demand balance at sustainable levels is only relevant to a smaller addressable market than it seemed to be for a while. It's natural for early-stage companies to operate at a loss as they build their initial foundation, but it's unnatural for a company that has been around for well over a decade to be persistently unprofitable as a matter of normal operation. Yet, weak money tends to lead to those types of companies increasing in prevalence.[^256]

Weak money encourages people to constantly borrow and invest rather than to save, whether that borrowing and investing make sense or not. Hard money encourages people to save, and to only borrow or invest when it seems like it really makes sense. Monetizing things of utility, such as corporate equity and real estate due to a lack of good monetary alternatives, has tangible negative effects and contributes to unnecessary bubbles. It can increase the cost of things that should otherwise just be for utility (such as single-family homes); it gives large and liquid companies an extra edge over smaller companies; and it slows down the process by which business pricing serves as a method of communicating to consumers and investors what is scarce and what is not, which can lead to a misallocation of resources for prolonged periods of time.

**Non-Transparent Supply Dilution**

Anyone who owns units of something with a flexible supply must be constantly vigilant against being diluted.

The World Gold Council estimates that there is a little over 200,000 tonnes in total above-ground refined gold in the world, which translates into about 7 billion ounces.[^257] Meanwhile, annual gold production is a little over 3,000 tonnes per year, and very little gold is destroyed or discarded every year. A holder of gold, therefore, must put up with the total gold supply increasing by about 1.5% per year. If they hold 10 one-ounce gold coins, then each year their amount of gold will represent a smaller and smaller percentage of all refined gold in the world. This rate of dilution has historically been fine because population growth and productivity growth have generally equaled or exceeded that 1.5% rate, and so each gold coin has maintained (or even mildly increased) its purchasing power for goods and services over centuries.

Any real estate investor knows that a big construction boom of new apartment complexes or new houses can have negative implications for existing house prices in an area. After a rapid period of new home construction, each previously existing house now represents a smaller piece of this expanded city, with plenty of new supply relative to demand, and so prices may stagnate or go down. This is good for new buyers but bad for existing owners. A way for property investors to defend against this over time has been to own very scarce property such as waterfront property, because no matter how big the surrounding area gets, builders can't really make more waterfront property --- unless they're willing to do something very expensive such as build entirely new islands to do so.

Fiat currency tends to have a much faster dilution rate than gold or real estate. As recently as 2010, U.S. broad money supply was under \$8.5 trillion. At the end of 2022, it was approximately \$21.4 trillion.[^258] This represents a 7.3% annualized growth rate. Meanwhile, most bank accounts paid next to zero interest on savings accounts and certificates of deposit for most of that time. Even if we round up the average savings account interest rate to 1% and exclude taxes on that interest, it means that the average cash deposit holder was diluted by 6.3% per year after interest. Each dollar they held represented a smaller and smaller percentage of all dollars, and at a much faster rate than what happened with gold or real estate. Of course, people can work and earn new dollars, but a lot of those new dollars that they earn would just be replacing the declining purchasing power of their existing dollars. It's like holding a bag of melting ice cubes and working to earn more melting ice cubes.

If commodities and/or foreign labor are abundant and low priced, and productivity keeps improving, then this rapid money supply growth might not translate to high consumer price inflation right away. Price inflation will be more industry-specific, such as prices of healthcare and childcare and attractive housing increasing at a much quicker pace than the price of shoes, grains, or foreign-made electronics. However, this rapid money supply growth environment does readily translate into an increase in asset prices for most things that are growing in supply more slowly than dollars. Is it any wonder, then, that throughout the 2010s, stocks basically went straight up, real estate basically went straight up, and fine art and other collectibles basically went straight up? Holding scarce or semi-scarce assets makes a lot of sense when money supply is growing at a pace that greatly exceeds the interest rate that holders get on cash and cash-equivalents.[^259]

This becomes even more problematic for the saver when interest taxes and capital gains taxes are considered. Cash and bonds are bad enough when their interest rate is at or below the rate of consumer price inflation and the rate of money supply growth, but then to make the situation even less favorable, people must pay taxes on the interest they make. So, the tax-adjusted and dilution-adjusted interest rate on their cash and bonds is even more negative. And taxes on capital gains, being unadjusted for inflation or money supply dilution, represent a wealth tax upon sale even if actual purchasing power didn't increase.

Suppose, for example, that you buy a \$300,000 house as an investment property. If, over the next decade, money supply growth goes up by 2% per year, and the average house price in the area goes up by 2% per year, then your house (if in line with the average) will be worth around \$365,000 by the end of the decade. If you decide to sell the house, you'll need to pay perhaps a 20% capital gains tax on that \$65,000 increase, which is \$13,000 in taxes or about 4.3% of the original house price, or about 3.6% of the current house price. The purchasing power of the house didn't really go up; it just kept pace with monetary dilution, and you were taxed on that increase anyway.

Now, suppose instead you buy the same \$300,000 house, but over the next decade, money supply growth goes up by 10% per year, and the average house price in the area goes up by 10% per year. At the end of this period, your house will be worth \$778,000 and if you sell it, you'll owe a 20% capital gains tax on the \$478,000 gain (totaling \$96,000 in taxes) even though the house price just kept pace with monetary dilution. This \$96,000 tax represents 32% of the original house price and 12.3% of the current house price, even though your purchasing power relative to other assets didn't really change. This shows that governments have an incentive to let inflation run hot, because thanks to capital gains taxes that are not adjusted for inflation or money supply dilution, they get a bigger share of transacted wealth if the dollar numbers are inflated.[^260]

This example shows that when the rate of money supply growth is elevated, not only do cash and bondholders lose purchasing power, but even holders of hard assets could lose purchasing power if their hard asset merely kept pace with monetary dilution and then they were taxed on that monetary dilution. The same would be true for holders of equities, gold, and similar assets if they are mainly just keeping up with monetary dilution.

The hard way to avoid this problem of monetary dilution is to be a superior investor. If someone selects assets that generate considerably above-average returns, then they can outperform monetary dilution.

The easier way for an investor to avoid that problem of losing purchasing power due to the taxation of monetary dilution is to make use of artificially low interest rates when they exist by taking out long-duration debt. If the above-mentioned house was purchased with a fixed-rate mortgage at a low interest rate at the start of the decade, then in such a rapid 10%-per-year monetary dilution environment, the home equity would have grown at a much faster percentage than the price of the house. This is because the mortgage liability is fixed while the house asset price is expanding rapidly, resulting in major equity growth. This type of borrower is basically shorting all the cash savers in the market and pocketing the difference.

In general, the modern inflationary financial system rewards people who have access to low interest rate debt and then use quite a bit of it judiciously. If they run into problems and are big enough, making mistakes might even get them a bailout. The key to success, in other words, has been to borrow money, but not so much that you're among the first entities to fail during a recession. Savers regularly get diluted, overleveraged entities regularly default, and the sweet spot has been to be permanently leveraged without being overleveraged.

Notably, when looking across the world today and when looking back historically, there is somewhat of a bell curve regarding the relationship between debt levels and monetary hardness.

Figure 17-C

In very weak money environments, such as many developing countries with frequent periods of double-digit inflation and/or rapid currency devaluations, you won't find much long-term debt. Few lenders would be foolish enough to issue a 30-year fixed rate mortgage or a 30-year corporate bond in these types of monetary environments, because there's little reason to trust that the unit of account won't be rapidly debased during that time.

Hard money environments, on the right tail of the bell curve, tend not to encounter too much total leverage either, because borrowers are less willing to borrow money in an appreciating unit of account unless they have high conviction that they can put it to very productive use (such as the build-out of the railroads in the 19th century[^261]). In those hard money environments, credit is still useful for activities with a high expected rate of return, but debt is used more judiciously.

Moderate money environments where fiat currencies devalue at a slow and steady rate hit the sweet spot for both lenders and borrowers. Borrowers happily take on moderate-term and long-term debt which devalues slowly over time and use it to acquire scarcer assets. Lenders happily lend at low rates as long as those rates are a bit higher than the cost of short-term financing, so that they can earn a spread on the difference, which they then lever up. Consumers, corporations, and governments all casually have 30-year debt on their balance sheets as a normal course of financing. Debt as a share of the economy tends to become maximally high in this scenario, which feels nice when it is all going up but becomes a severe problem when currency volatility one day finally returns against such a highly indebted system. In other words, due to the amount of debt accumulation that tends to occur within gradually devaluing currency systems, the carefully managed stability of this type of system is what eventually leads to its dramatic instability, and its inability to withstand periods of deflation.
