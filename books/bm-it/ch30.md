# Chapter 25: *How Bitcoin Uses Energy**

In 2017, the World Economic Forum published an article about how the Bitcoin network could consume all the world's energy by 2020.[^363] *Newsweek* published a similar piece in the same month about the same subject, and so did several other media outlets and institutions.[^364]

They ended up being off by three orders of magnitude. By 2020 the network was still consuming less than 0.1% of global energy consumption. As I write this book during 2022 and 2023, it's still a tiny fraction of one percent.

There has been no shortage of alarmist and factually incorrect analysis of the Bitcoin network's energy consumption over the years. This chapter covers how Bitcoin consumes energy and what types of energy it tends to consume.[^365] The important takeaways are that 1) Bitcoin's energy usage in the long run is strictly limited by the utility it provides to users, and that 2) Bitcoin primarily consumes stranded energy that would otherwise be wasted.

**Mining Revenue: Subsidies and Transaction Fees**

Looking at total bitcoin mining revenue gives us a decent proxy for the upper limit to how much money the network can collectively spend on electricity each year. Electricity represents miners' biggest operating expense by far; over a multi-year period, miners need to remain solvent and thus can't spend more than they make. Miners of course also have equipment costs, real estate costs, and labor costs. Miners can also make some side revenue streams by buying electricity usage rights for low prices and selling them at certain times for high prices during shortages, or by making profitable use of the waste heat from their processors. Both of those uses are productive.

When Bitcoin was created, it was designed so that every ten minutes when a miner produces a new block of transactions, the miner that produced it earns 50 newly generated bitcoin. After four years, the network was pre-programmed to drop to 25 new bitcoin per block. Four years later, it was 12.5 bitcoin per block. Four years after that, it was down to 6.25 bitcoin per block. These newly created coins are referred to as the "block subsidy" and represent most of bitcoin miners' revenue in this era of the network.

This pattern will continue every four years until new bitcoin generation reaches zero, and the hard cap of 21 million bitcoin is reached sometime after the year 2100. Within a few decades, miners will earn a vanishingly small number of fractional bitcoin for producing new blocks. Out of the 21 million total bitcoin, nearly 19.5 million have already been created.

However, miners also earn transaction fees. Senders pay transaction fees, denominated in fractional bitcoin, to ensure their transaction gets into the blockchain in a timely manner. In the early days, blocks were often not full, so transaction fees were minimal. When Bitcoin usage became more widespread, blocks frequently became full, and transaction fees became a small but more meaningful portion of miner fees.

Figure 25-A shows the Bitcoin network's average market capitalization, annual miner revenue (including block subsidies and transaction fees), and the percentage of the market capitalization spent on miner revenue each year.



Figure 25-A

Bitcoin miner revenue has grown at a historically strong rate, but the network always spent a smaller percentage of its market capitalization on miner revenue than the prior year. This isn't a decision by any centralized party; it's a combination of the declining block subsidy and individual miner decisions regarding whether to mine or not based on the economics of the situation.

That declining block subsidy is what journalists and other people who don't understand the algorithm often miss. It results in Bitcoin's supply inflation rate going down, along with miner revenue as a percentage of Bitcoin's total market capitalization, until it reaches more of a steady state based on transaction fees alone.

Ironically, some analysts and critics of the network are concerned that BitcoinÂ *won't use enough energy* to remain secure in the future when it relies mostly on transaction fees. I don't view that as being a significant risk, but it has a higher likelihood of being a problem than the reverse situation of the network using too much energy (which by design is impossible; it can only use energy over the long run if people are getting a lot of utility out of it).

Figure 25-B shows just the portion of the miner revenue that comes from transaction fees, which is a subset of the previous table.



Figure 25-B

We can see that transaction fees are a tiny portion of Bitcoin's market capitalization each year. The highest year in percentage terms was 2017 during that bubble peak. Efficiency improvements such as SegWit, transaction batching, and reductions in OP_Return usage have occurred since 2017, so fees have been rather muted since 2017 despite an increase in network usage. As of this writing in the midpoint of the year, 2023 is shaping up to be a higher fee year than 2022, which was unusually low.

The Bitcoin network is now down to less than 2% of its market cap being spent on miner revenue each year, including a tiny fraction of one percent on fees. In 2024 there will be another block subsidy halving, which may bring miner revenue down closer to 1% of market capitalization or less. In 2028 there will be yet another block subsidy halving, and another in 2032. After that point, the block subsidy will be so tiny that a large portion of miner revenue will be made up of transaction fees, and miner revenue will likely be less than 1% of market capitalization, approaching some steady-state situation based on fees that is hard to model (since it depends on overall network adoption, utility, and velocity).

Since we can't know for sure what the steady state will be due to variable market-driven transaction fees, Figure 25-C shows what assumptions are needed to reach a certain annual miner revenue figure. Potential long-term Bitcoin market capitalizations are shown on the vertical axis and annual miner revenue as a percentage of market capitalizations are shown on the horizontal axis, allowing the reader to see what each combination would result in for annual miner revenue.



Figure 25-C

If Bitcoin fails to grow for one reason or another and becomes a stagnant project or permanently remains around its current market capitalization of less than \$1 trillion, its miner revenue will significantly decrease from current levels as block subsidies diminish. By the 2030s, bitcoin miner revenue will probably be around 0.50% of market capitalization or less, and so the network will be stagnant at 2018-2020 energy spending levels or less.

If Bitcoin becomes systemically important, such as \$5-\$10 trillion in network value (representing a per-coin price of \$250k to \$500k) with hundreds of millions of users, then at 0.50% annual miner revenue relative to market capitalization, that would be \$25-\$50 billion. This could represent perhaps 0.3% to 0.5% of global energy usage.

If it reaches a very high price of one million dollars per coin, for a critically important market capitalization of \$20 trillion or more, with billions of users, then at 0.25% to 0.50% annual miner revenue relative to market capitalization, that would be \$50-\$100 billion. This could represent perhaps 0.6% to 1.0% of global energy usage, which seems appropriate for a network used by billions of people for multiple purposes, as it would need to be at that point in order to reach such a high value.

By that point, Bitcoin would be big enough that it would likely be replacing energy used by parts of the global banking system, rather than adding to it. There are tens of millions of people working in banks and fintech companies around the world, with energy-intensive office buildings, office equipment, payment servers, and tons of administrative overhead. The application of software to money at the root layer, just like other industries, can create efficiencies and reduce the need for employment and equipment and real estate and overhead in certain parts of legacy infrastructure, freeing up those human resources and corresponding energy uses for other productive purposes.

We can also run these figures for annual transaction volumes rather than market capitalization, which is likely a better way of looking at it. Volumes are more closely tied to the fee market than market capitalization is, but transaction volume is harder to measure than market capitalization, since there are multiple different ways to measure transaction volume.

For example, if a person sends bitcoin from one address that they control to another address that they control, should that count as part of the network's transaction volume? Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics firm, calculates an adjusted estimate of Bitcoin network transaction volume that excludes various short-term transaction hops (therefore factoring out a lot of exchange cold storage shuffling and the usage of privacy tools). Figure 25-D shows the network's monetary velocity by year, as calculated from average market capitalization and annual adjusted transaction volumes.



Figure 25-D

Figure 25-E is a table of the Bitcoin network's adjusted transaction volume, annual miner revenue (including block subsidies and transaction fees), and the percentage of the annual adjusted volume spent on miner revenue each year.



Figure 25-E

Figure 25-F is the same table, but only including the transaction fee portion of miner revenue.



Figure 25-F

We can see in that table that fees were miniscule until 2017. That was when blocks started to become full on a regular basis, and a meaningful fee market developed.

Now that a lot of block space efficiency gains have been realized while the network continues to grow, I expect that potential future increases in transaction volume will create more persistent upward fee pressure by the end of the 2020s decade. This will likely lead to higher structural average transaction fees, but these fees would still be a very low percentage of the average transaction size. As mentioned previously, as of this writing 2023 is shaping up to be a higher fee year than 2022, although it isn't included in the chart since the year is only halfway finished.

Figure 25-G shows potential long-term Bitcoin annual adjusted transaction volumes on the vertical axis and annual miner fees as a percentage of annual adjusted transaction volumes on the horizontal axis, so that the reader can see what assumptions are needed to arrive at various annual miner revenue estimates.



Figure 25-G

It's hard to say what the Bitcoin network's on-chain transaction volume or adjusted volume will be in a couple of decades. This will depend on a combination of adoption and monetary velocity. Right now, bitcoin are primarily used for investment/savings purposes and less so for spending, and therefore on-chain velocity is low. If we reach a pivot point where bitcoin is more integrated into financial institutions, the exchange rate becomes less volatile, and more people use bitcoin for payments, then its monetary velocity could increase by quite a bit, resulting in some of the higher-end energy usage estimates coming to pass (perhaps upwards of 1% of global energy) in exchange for providing tremendous utility.

Today, the Bitcoin network's electricity consumption is estimated to emit less carbon dioxide than random things we don't think about, like tumble driers or zinc production. If the world was 10% more efficient at turning off our always-on electronic devices when not in use, it would save more electricity than the Bitcoin network consumes.[^366]

If Bitcoin becomes wildly successful with trillions of dollars of utility for users, we could potentially see it consume an amount of energy per year that is comparable to the aluminum production industry. In other words, despite reaching a massive scale and serving numerous purposes as a global monetary network, it would still be comparable in energy usage to various other random industries that we don't generally become morally panicked about.[^367]

**Scaling By Layers and the "Cost Per Transaction" Fallacy**

The Bitcoin network can do a maximum of several hundred thousand base layer transactions per day. That's about five transactions per second. The theoretical limit has increased moderately over time due to occasional upgrades that improve transaction density.

This transaction limit is often unfavorably compared to credit card networks, which can process tens of thousands of transactions per second. Due to that, critics often point out that Bitcoin's energy usage per transaction is very high, and thus the network is inefficient and should be avoided for environmental reasons.

The first problem with that reasoning is the fact that Bitcoin uses energy whether transactions are occurring or not, due to the block subsidy that miners earn when they produce a new block, regardless of how many transactions are in that block. The way to think about it is that a large portion of that energy is used simply for securing the network against transaction censoring or deep block re-organizations, and therefore keeping it attractive as a settlement network and store of value while it's still in its nascent state. One block might have 1,200 transactions. The next block might have 2,500 transactions. The block after that might have 1,800 transactions. Meanwhile, the same number of miners are hooked up to the network between those subsequent blocks, using the same amount of electricity. Whether blocks are full or not, they're using roughly the same amount of electricity. And each new block is further securing all prior transactions stretching back to the genesis block.

Whether you choose to make a transaction or not does not materially change how much energy the Bitcoin network is using at that time. Bitcoin's energy usage comes from miners expending energy to earn the block subsidy and average transaction fees; it's denominated in bitcoin and thus based on the value per bitcoin, which mainly comes from people holding bitcoin as a store of value, not spending it. Transaction volumes only affect the transaction fee portion, and only the longer-run average transaction fee matters.[^368] Mining hardware is purchased with expectations of running those machines for five or more years. Every bitcoin block increases the finality of all blocks below it, and by extension assures the immutability of the entire blockchain, rather than just performing the transactions that it contains.

You can think of this concept like running your dishwasher each night. Whether it's 30% or 90% full when you run it, it still uses about the same amount of resources per run. The marginal extra dish or utensil doesn't materially affect the dishwasher's energy usage, and thus the "water per dish" metric isn't particularly relevant. Another analogy would be keeping your computer on all day, and either sending 20 emails or 100 emails. The marginal amount of "electricity per email" that you send isn't relevant, because regardless of how many emails you send that day, your computer is on and is using approximately its baseline resource level.

The second problem with that reasoning is the idea that this limit of about five transactions per second is the true limit when it isn't. In reality, the Bitcoin network has multiple layers, just like the current financial system. The base layer that we know as Bitcoin is a settlement network.

Credit card networks are merely layers on top of a deeper payment network. In the United States, as described in prior chapters, we have the Fedwire system which settles approximately one quadrillion dollars of gross volume per year. That's the gross settlement layer that banks use to perform large transactions with each other. This system performs approximately the same number of transactions as the Bitcoin network per year and has scaled up slowly as needed, but those Fedwire transaction amounts are very large, representing millions of dollars each. On top of that layer, there are things like Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Venmo, people writing physical checks to each other, and so forth.

If you send me a credit card payment, for example, that seems instantaneous to both of us, but behind the scenes it is not. When the transaction seems finished to us, behind the scenes our two banks just conversed and made an IOU between themselves. Sometime later, they will batch it with many other consumer transactions and settle their books with a big settlement transaction. There's no limit to how many surface-layer payments can occur, because there is no limit to the size of those massive settlement transactions. Each settlement transaction represents thousands of smaller payments.

Similarly, the Bitcoin network has additional layers: Lightning, sidechains, custodial ecosystems, and more. However, unlike the banking system that depends on significant settlement times and IOUs, many of Bitcoin's layers are designed to minimize trust and avoid the use of credit, via software with programmable contracts and short settlement times.

**Why Bitcoin Miners are Unusual Energy Buyers**

Beyond a simple calculation of how much energy Bitcoin uses, we should also consider the details for how it uses energy and the types of energy it uses.

People often imagine bitcoin miners competing with other industries for electricity, as though bitcoin mining must push out some other use of electricity. However, because bitcoin miners are competing in a very commoditized global business, they inherently require extremely cheap electricity and therefore *can't* compete with normal users of electricity. As a result, bitcoin miners seek out inefficiencies around the world where electricity is being underutilized, wasted, and thrown away nearly for free.

Most energy consumers can't go to where the energy is; the energy must be brought to them. Humans organize themselves based on geography, and historically that was mainly around shipping channels. We live in coastal or riverside cities, in the suburbs of those areas, and around rural areas of fertile land. We don't live around energy sources. Rather than move to where the oil and gas and uranium deposits are, we send folks out to go get the oil and gas and uranium and bring it back to us for consumption in our homes and at gas stations and nearby nuclear stations.

Bitcoin miners are unusual energy consumers in the sense that they can go to wherever the energy source is, as long as they can get some sort of basic low-bandwidth internet connection, including a satellite connection if needed. That means they use energy in quite efficient and unusual ways, and we don't usually see bitcoin miners near cities where electricity tends to be more expensive.

Fidelity's first digital asset analyst and later founding partner of Castle Island Ventures, Nic Carter, publicly described Bitcoin's energy usage in an insightful way back in 2018:

> An interesting externality of PoW coins --- they are always-willing energy buyers at 3-5 cents/kWH. And some of the best energy assets are off the grid. This global energy net liberates stranded assets and makes new ones viable.[^369]
>
> Imagine a 3D topographic map of the world with cheap energy hotspots being lower and expensive energy being higher. I imagine Bitcoin mining being akin to a glass of water poured over the surface, settling in the nooks and crannies, and smoothing it out.[^370]

In 2021, I performed extensive research on bitcoin miners to examine the details and have continued to follow up on that work annually. In that first year, I reached out to Marty Bent, who at the time was the director of business development for a private bitcoin mining company called Great American Mining. Currently he is a board director for Cathedra, a publicly traded bitcoin mining company. He explained some of the details, which continue to be true today:

> Since the Bitcoin network is a distributed peer-to-peer network that doesn't depend on any one miner to facilitate transactions, bitcoin miners are better positioned to take advantage of the flare gas opportunity compared to other energy intensive compute processes like server farms because they can stomach disruptions in the field without affecting the uptime of the network materially. Whereas a server farm would not be able to because uptime disruption could seriously affect critical business operations. Beyond this, the amount of data that miners send to mining pools is very small and doesn't require much bandwidth, so they can operate in very remote areas using cellular data much more trivially than other energy intensive data processes.[^371]

Although some miners use cheap forms of traditional energy, the following sections offer a sampling of some of the novel ways that bitcoin miners use otherwise stranded or unwanted energy to the benefit of themselves and their counterparties.

**1) Stranded Hydroelectric Power Bitcoin Mining**

For a long time, China was the largest bitcoin mining jurisdiction. At their peak, Chinese miners in aggregate accounted for over 70% of the network, but by spring of 2021 it was estimated to have gradually dipped to under 50%, as more competition arose elsewhere. Then, a 2021 ban on Chinese bitcoin mining, likely to enforce their capital controls, sharply reduced Chinese bitcoin mining exposure, and a significant subset of those miners went elsewhere.[^372]

However, for many years, China was an interesting example of bitcoin mining mobility. The province of Sichuan has a lot of overbuilt hydroelectric capacity. During the wet season, they produce more clean electricity than they can possibly use, and so it is wasted. It is stranded power.

Since bitcoin miners can go to where the energy source is, they used to flock to Sichuan during the wet season to make use of that otherwise wasted energy. This was not because they are altruistic environmentalists, but simply because it is cheap and nobody else was making use of it. Electricity that would otherwise be wasted and generate no revenue for the operator, can be sold for extremely cheap levels to someone who can find a use for it, such as bitcoin miners in this case.

With the Chinese bitcoin mining ban of 2021, many of those machines and billions of dollars' worth of annual revenue that they can produce moved to North America and other countries. But for many years, this was a great example of bitcoin miners mopping up stranded and wasted energy. Even after the ban, Chinese bitcoin miners reemerged in a smaller way, because it's hard to fully stamp the industry out.[^373]

Many other countries face similar issues with unused portions of hydroelectric power generation and have become bitcoin mining jurisdictions for that reason. Any unused hydroelectric power can be monetized for bitcoin mining, and otherwise may go to waste.

**2) Stranded Natural Gas Bitcoin Mining**

Many types of petroleum deposits come withÂ associated natural gas.

If there is enough of this gas, it can be collected and sent via pipeline or other transport networks to be used as a primary energy source, since of course natural gas is extremely useful for electricity and heating. However, if it's a small amount, then it's not economical enough to build a pipeline or otherwise collect that gas.

So, what happens? It gets vented or flared into the atmosphere, and therefore wasted. Venting means just letting the gas out into the atmosphere, mainly as methane (which is a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide). Flaring means the gas is burned for no productive purpose, and thus converted into carbon dioxide and emitted into the atmosphere. It's a complete waste, either way, and yet still contributing to global greenhouse gases.

In terms of scale, the World Bank uses satellite data to estimate that 144 billion cubic meters of natural gas is vented or flared per year throughout the world.[^374] That wasted energy alone is enough to power the entire Bitcoin network several times over, according to the University of Cambridge's analysis on the Bitcoin network's energy usage.[^375]

There are several private bitcoin mining companies that specialize in hooking up trailers of bitcoin miners on oil production sites with stranded gas to make use of that otherwise-wasted energy. This is a win-win scenario for oil producers and the bitcoin miners. The producers get to sell their stranded gas rather than waste it, while earning higher environmental scores and meeting state flaring limits. Running gas through an electric generator is more efficient at converting methane to carbon dioxide than flaring it. Bitcoin miners get a cheap source of electricity in the process.

**3) Landfill Gas Bitcoin Mining**

Aside from the associated natural gas that is found along with oil deposits, another big way that methane leaks into the atmosphere is through landfills. On a global basis, billions of cubic meters of methane leak out of landfills from decomposing organic matter. Some of the largest landfills capture this methane and use it to generate useful energy, but many smaller landfills around the world, or even large landfills that don't have economic usage for it, just let it leak into the atmosphere.

A company called Vespene Energy raised \$4.3 million in 2022 to deploy bitcoin miners at landfill sites to make use of this methane. By capturing methane and burning it into carbon dioxide, it creates usable energy and reduces the overall greenhouse effect. And the only way to make the incentive work is if there is some energy buyer that is flexible enough to set up at small and mid-sized landfills, like bitcoin miners.

> BERKELEY, Calif.,Â Aug. 9, 2022Â /PRNewswire/ --- Vespene Energy, a methane mitigation company, today announced the close of aÂ \$4.3MÂ financing round led by Polychain Capital, and joined by a number of climate-focused funds. Vespene installs highly efficient micro-turbines on municipal landfills to convert waste methane into electricity to power a variety of on-site uses, the first of which will be Bitcoin mining data-centers. Vespene's immediately deployable, and highly scalable technology, enables municipal landfill operators to monetize an otherwise stranded asset while reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions.[^376]

As of this writing, Vespene describes their process on their homepage as follows:

> We leverage landfill methane to create an on-site energy source that can support broad EV fleet electrification and other variable facility loads. By pairing energy generation with interruptible data processing, we ensure that methane is fully destroyed and the energy is always put to beneficial use.[^377]

"Interruptible data processing" in this context is primarily a description of bitcoin mining, and likely phrased in that way to avoid concerning people who would otherwise be interested in their services but have incorrect and negative connotations about Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining is just a form of computation and data processing as it relates to transaction ordering, and unlike other uses of data centers, individual bitcoin miners are highly interruptible and flexible.

Some people ask, "can't we capture this methane without bitcoin miners?" but the problem is that without proper economic incentives, it just doesn't happen. People can theorize about what should happen, but then don't do it themselves. The only way it happens at some of the smaller landfill or flare gas sites is for highly flexible consumers of electricity to come in and profitably make use of it on site, and for that purpose bitcoin mining is the most direct way to do it.

This is a new industry, and startups come and go. I don't know how successful this specific company will be over the next five or ten years. But what I do know is that landfills around the world leak energy-dense methane into the atmosphere, and there hasn't historically been a cost-effective, flexible way to make use of it.

**4) Bitcoin Mining as a Grid Battery**

Electrical grids must constantly adjust for two things: changing electricity supply levels and changing electricity demand levels.

Some electrical sources are very consistent, like baseload nuclear power, which can run 24/7. Other sources, like wind and solar and to some extent hydro, are more variable based on what Mother Nature feels like providing in terms of wind, sun, and rain during a given timeframe. Due to this partial variability, electrical production needs to be overbuilt, so that even on a particularly "low" day of electricity generation, it's still sufficient to provide power to the community as demanded.

On the demand side, there are certain days or seasons that require more electricity than others. For example, I use a lot more gas in winter than in summer, because in the summer it's only used for cooking while in the winter it's used for cooking *and* heating. Meanwhile, I use way more electricity in the summer, since I'm using it for air conditioning in that season, in addition to all my normal baseline usage. Plus, there are peak days, such as the most dangerously hot day of a given year, where just about every single household has the air conditioning system on full blast. Days like that need to be designed for by the electrical grid's engineers. Electricity is more heavily used during certain times of day than others as well.

Plus, electricity can only be sent so far. The longer it is sent over transmission lines, the more loss (waste) occurs. In other words, electricity is somewhat local.

Therefore, due to variability on both the supply side and the demand side on an hourly basis, daily basis, and seasonal basis, electrical grids need to be overbuilt, and to have a lot more power generation capacity than is used on the average day. Some of that capacity could be variable, like natural gas peaking plants that can be rapidly turned on or off as needed to produce electrical power during moments of peak demand. Other types might be ones they can't control, like solar panels and wind turbines. If a power generation company overbuilds solar capacity and wind capacity and isn't using the excess or selling it to another grid, then the electricity is just wasted.

One of the problems with solar and wind power is that the cost of energy storage is very high. Despite all our human ingenuity, we still can't make very cost-effective batteries at a scale suitable for electric utilities because they require a lot of metals and mining. It's an extraordinarily hard physics problem. We can of course make storage batteries for certain niche use-cases, but it's not cost effective or environmentally friendly to use them very broadly on a large scale.[^378]

Bitcoin mining makes it profitable to overbuild renewable sources of energy production, since it allows that surplus supply to be monetized. Every community that wants reliable power needs overbuilt electric capacity anyway, and for wind, solar, and hydro that's even more important because they are variable. However, overbuilding is usually not very cost effective, unless it can be used for something profitable and useful when it's not otherwise needed.

Bitcoin miners are a unique solution to that problem by making overbuilding profitable, and thus play the indirect role of an energy storage solution.

During most of the time when there is more supply than demand, bitcoin miners as one of the electricity consumers in the community can power their machines, earn revenue, and pay their electricity costs. If there is a surge in electricity demand or a reduction in supply that would otherwise cause electricity outages in the region, those bitcoin miners can temporarily shut off.

A well-structed commercial rates contract can make this work smoothly. The utility can offer the miner the lowest possible rate in the area, in exchange for them having a higher tolerance for variability and other points of contract flexibility.

Harry Sudock, the Chief Strategy Officer at a bitcoin mining company called GRIID, explained this to Peter McCormackÂ on his podcast in June 2021:

> \[Curtailing is\] not the position you ever want to be in as the energy generator. So, let's use a wind turbine as a really easy example. The turbine goes around once, generates electrons. The market price in some regions is negative, so what they'll choose to do is just not to send the energy anywhere. It dissipates.
>
> So, if they're able to strike a deal with another bidder on that energy who can tolerate some intermittent consumption, can use it some of the time, not the other part of the time, that's a really valuable customer to be able to bring to a market that isn't necessarily able to support the energy generation on a broader basis.
>
> So, I think bitcoin miners are special and are a huge technological upgrade from the traditional consumers of electricity. We have two, I think of as "energy superpowers": the first one is that energy is 80% or 90% of our monthly costs; the second is that we can consume on an intermittent basis without harming our business model particularly. So, if someone tells me I need you to shut off your miners 100 hours a year, or 500 hours a year, we don't say no, we just say, "We need to reflect that in the energy price we pay".
>
> So, when I'm looking to negotiate a power contract, the way that I frame this is, "I need you to get me the lowest possible cost that you know how to offer. I'm willing to negotiate on every other part of the profile of the load. How big are we going to build the mine; how often do you need that power back; do you need us to serve any other creative purpose within your energy mix or system; do you need us to split our facility into two and to go locate at two different points within place? Great. Do we need to be able to contribute to the security budget of these other pieces of the operation?"
>
> Our job is to drive that energy price as low and competitive as possible and work with producers on every other variable.[^379]

For clarity on Sudock's quote, I would add that their third superpower is their ability to co-locate with the source of electricity generation, and thus cut down on transmission losses to help keep their electricity cheap. Bitcoin miners are unique in that 1) most of their operating expense is electricity, 2) they can tolerate intermittent electricity supply, and 3) they are flexible with their location. As a result, they can sacrifice variables that most other companies cannot, in exchange for requiring rock-bottom electricity prices when electricity is abundant.

Due to their ability to go to the source of power, bitcoin miners can also fill in unexpected holes in demand, or other special situations. In that same podcast, Sudock described this situation:

> This is an anecdote that we're in the midst of working through right now. A community is zoned to have a new hospital built in their area. There are 17,000 energy customers, house to house, in that utility's jurisdiction. They are going to bring a hospital that is going to double the amount of energy that this region pulls down. We can all agree that a hospital is a very worthy use of electricity, no argument there.
>
> They rebuild the transmission lines, they build a new substation that's bigger, that can handle the additional load, and after they do all that, the hospital project falls apart.
>
> So, they're left having invested millions of dollars in this area to attract this large customer. They now have to pass that cost back to those 17,000 households, unless they can find another use for that energy. So, what did they do? They called our VP of Energy Management and said, "We've got an overbuilt supply here. If we don't bring in a large-scale energy customer, these costs are going to get passed to these households that don't have the budget to support rising energy prices."
>
> So, we have this beautiful opportunity to come in, backstop this utility, provide a customer to come in on the back of this deal falling apart, and provide the backbone to this community and to stabilize their energy prices for a decade to come. And so, these are the stories of bitcoin mining that don't get to rise to the surface. It also happens that this energy source is over 60% carbon-free.[^380]

When I began publishing research articles about Bitcoin's energy usage in 2021, including describing these various types of power purchase agreements, the network had historically been too small and niche for grid engineers to incorporate it into their plans. Starting in 2022, these power curtailment agreements became more widespread and publicly reported on. Large, publicly traded bitcoin miners in the United States repeatedly curtailed their electricity usage through various fluctuations in 2022 and 2023, major energy producers began setting up bitcoin mining operations, and the Tokyo Electric Power Grid announced plans to mine bitcoin with excess energy.[^381]

If the Bitcoin network gets big enough, every always-on source of electricity generation can have bitcoin mining equipment co-located with it, to profitably soak up the variable difference between the supply of that power and the surrounding grid demand for that power, so that it doesn't go to waste. That lowers the cost for the producer and the consumer of that power and can make variable energy sources more cost effective. In other words, spare electricity can always be directed toward useful computation. In this sense, the transaction processing of the Bitcoin network gets dispersed into all the little inefficiencies that exist throughout the global energy system.

This is why I wouldn't consider it a bad thing even if Bitcoin did exceed 1% of global energy usage; by that point it would be highly optimized into the energy system and likely be a net good for the energy system, rather than a net bad.

Bitcoin mining is a highly commoditized industry. The only way for a bitcoin miner to remain solvent over the long run is to use the cheapest sources of electricity, and the cheapest sources are the ones that are otherwise stranded or wasted. During a temporary bitcoin bull run, bitcoin miners can get away with using just about any source of electricity and remain profitable, but over multiple bull/bear cycles, the trend is clear: Only the cheapest sources of electricity are viable for bitcoin miners that wish to remain solvent cycle after cycle. They'll need to make agreements with grids to help balance the load, and/or be co-located with the electricity producer to monetize surplus electricity, and/or they'll need to make use of various geographically stranded off-grid energy resources.

**5) Bitcoin Miners as Heaters**

Most of the energy consumed by bitcoin miners is released as heat. A computer processor is basically a heater that happens to perform calculations while it heats. One of the ways to make bitcoin mining cost effective, in addition to finding the cheapest (and thus stranded) sources of electricity, is to use the heat for productive purposes.

A person or company can literally replace a space heater or pool heater with a bitcoin miner, although they do have a higher up-front cost in exchange for generating revenue while they heat. On a larger scale, industrial space heaters and greenhouse heaters can be replaced by bitcoin miners as well. Novel implementations have already done this, but as the network matures over time, I expect every bit of advantage to be exploited by miners, including finding ways to use waste heat more than they do now.

It wouldn't make any sense to dislike space heaters that happen to also perform computations while they produce that heat, compared to normal space heaters that just heat without doing anything else. The antagonism toward the Bitcoin network's electricity usage is inherently based on the belief that the electricity is wasted, when really that electricity goes toward 1) securing the Bitcoin network, and 2) heating the area around the processor.

Satoshi himself observed this back in 2010, since discussions around Bitcoin\'s environmental impact were brought up right from the beginning. Here is how Satoshi envisioned it:

> The heat from your computer is not wasted if you need to heat your home. If you\'re using electric heat where you live, then your computer\'s heat isn\'t a waste. It\'s equal cost if you generate the heat with your computer. If you have other cheaper heating than electric, then the waste is only the difference in cost. If it\'s summer and you\'re using A/C, then it\'s twice. Bitcoin generation should end up where it\'s cheapest. Maybe that will be in cold climates where there\'s electric heat, where it would be essentially free.[^382]

**6) Advancing New Energy Technologies**

A company called Product Recovery Technology International or "PRTI" for short has spent the last decade converting wasted tires into hydrocarbon commodities. The world throws out over a billion tires per year, made from hydrocarbons, and most of them are just burned or buried.

PRTI developed a unique sealed boiler process to take those wasted tires and boil them down into their various hydrocarbon commodities and sell those commodities. However, they also produce some natural gas in this process, which they can use to generate electricity. Since their locations tend to be wherever the tires are sent to rather than in dense population centers, their local electrical grid doesn't generally have very much use for that electricity and can only pay very low rates for it. And it's not enough spare gas to build a pipeline or otherwise use it for many purposes.

So, PRTI takes that extra natural gas that they generate, and mines bitcoin on site with it. This improves the economics of the operation, so that they can continue to do the good work of recycling tires and thereby cutting down on that massive global source of pollutants and litter. Bitcoin mining just happens to be the most economic use of the stranded energy they produce from their innovative process.

As another example, there is a form of renewable baseload power called Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion or "OTEC" for short. It was first successfully demonstrated a century ago but hasn't taken off. As large amounts of solar energy strike the world's oceans, it heats the surface significantly compared to the colder depths. This column of warmth represents a way to generate electricity and represents a natural energy storage medium. Using a giant tube and a specific energy conversion process, large platforms or ships can tap into this difference between warm surface water and cold deep water to generate baseload power. They can use this to generate electricity and send it to land directly or can use the electricity to produce liquid fuels.[^383]

The problem with OTEC so far has been about scaling. Small OTEC plants have been demonstrated for test purposes but are uneconomical. Medium-sized OTEC plants don't make much sense either, because they require a lot of infrastructure to get that power back to land relative to how much power is being generated. Large OTEC plants do make economic sense, but nobody will build a large one before medium-sized ones are properly tested.

However, medium-sized OTEC plants could be economical if they don't need to send their power back to land. If they can be free roaming offshore and go to the warmest parts of the ocean near the equator, then even at that middle size they can potentially be economical. The problem is that there isn't any demand for electricity out in the middle of the ocean, or at least there didn't use to be. If they put bitcoin miners on the OTEC ship, then they can monetize the electricity out in the ocean, prove the concept, and hopefully one day get funding for the large-sized platforms that can power coastal populations.

A company called OceanBit is attempting to do just that. With bitcoin mining, they believe they can rejuvenate OTEC as an active area of research and development. One of their co-founders, Nathaniel Harmon, also developed a method to incorporate bitcoin mining directly into the OTEC process, by using some of the cold water that they are pumping up to keep the miners cool and adding the hot waste heat from the miners into the warm surface water that they're already using. I spoke with the co-founders Nathaniel Harmon and Michael Bennett in depth about their work in 2022, and as someone with a background in electrical engineering, I find the technology to be promising.

**7) Bootstrapping Developing Country Electricity Infrastructure**

Many low-income countries have a lot of energy resources, including hydroelectric capacity. However, they often have a chicken-and-egg problem. It's expensive and uncertain for developers to build the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure to move that power from where it is generated to where it would be consumed. People in non-electrified areas don't have much money or electronic devices, and so the developer has trouble seeing how they will get a return on their investment. But for people in those areas to get more money and use more electronic devices, they need electricity to be available to them. Electricity is a key ingredient to becoming more productive and generating more wealth.

Bitcoin presents an interesting opportunity for some of these developing areas to build out their electrical capacity and generate revenue. If a power source is developed, bitcoin miners can come in and give that site immediate profits as a guaranteed anchor buyer at low prices, until that electricity is put to better use as more people in the area begin to use electronic devices over the following years. As Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation described in a 2021 article called "The Humanitarian and Environmental Case for Bitcoin":

> Billions of people in developing nations face the stranded power problem. In order for their economies to grow, they have to expand their electrical infrastructure, a capital-intensive and complex undertaking. But when they, with the help of foreign aid or investment, build power plants to try and capture renewable energy in remote places, that power often has nowhere to go.
>
> In many countries across Africa, for example, there are vast solar, wind and hydro resources. These forces could drive economic activity, but local communities and governments usually lack the resources to invest in the infrastructure to kickstart the process.
>
> Foreign donors and investors are not keen to support projects that do not have a pathway to sustainability or profits. Without strong transmission lines to deliver energy from harvest points to population centers, power plant builders could wait years before they can run without foreign subsidy.
>
> Here is where Bitcoin could be an incentives game-changer. New power plants, no matter how remote, can generate immediate revenue, even with no transmission lines, by directing their energy to the Bitcoin network and turning sunlight, water or wind into money.
>
> As local authorities or customers gradually link up to the power plant, and are willing to pay more for the energy than what miners can afford, the Bitcoin load is lowered, and communities can grow. In this way, economic activity and renewable grids can be bootstrapped by Bitcoin mining. And international aid could provide the spark.[^384]

In 2020, Ross Stevens, the founder and CEO for the alternative asset manager Stone Ridge presented an interesting perspective on Bitcoin's energy usage. He described how bitcoin mining is the first profitable use of energy in human history that doesn't need to be situated near human settlements. Instead, bitcoin mining can be situated near sources of untapped energy, which allows for the development of infrastructure and provides an incentive for people to come and settle near the untapped energy source. As he wrote in his December 2020 shareholder letter:

> Thus, Bitcoin can make monetizable isolated energy sources all over the world -- like waterfalls, running rivers, or creatable dams -- now entirely untapped because they would be cost prohibitive to connect to electric grids close enough to residential or industrial areas.
>
> In doing so, Bitcoin can fundamentally change the economics of energy by introducing a highly profitable use of electricity that's location independent. The world has never had a profitable use of energy that's location independent. Now it does. And since fossil fuels are already too expensive to be a profitable source of Bitcoin mining energy, I believe the only long-term, profitable Bitcoin mining will be powered by hydro.
>
> Imagine a future with Bitcoin mining firms, unsubsidized, in extraordinarily isolated locations -- visualize a waterfall in a largely population-free part of an African country suffering from abject poverty -- easily connected to the Bitcoin network, building serious energy infrastructure to monetize the local clean energy source for mining. However, once the industrial-strength, profitable infrastructure is in place, let's extend it. Let's build roads. And housing. And schools. And hospitals. Ultimately leading to human settlement.
>
> The net result can be people locating around new, Bitcoin-driven hydroelectric energy infrastructure, with more and more of humanity clustering around cheap, clean energy sources. Historically, our energy challenge has been to move the power to the people. With Bitcoin, we can move the people to the power.[^385]

During 2022, this vision started to become a reality in Africa. A company called Gridless began using bitcoin mining to incentivize and sustain the deployment of small-river hydropower in locations in East Africa. As of this writing, here is how they describe it on their homepage:

> There is immense demand for reliable, clean, and affordable energy across Africa, yet mini-grid energy generators struggle for sustainability. Gridless works with renewable, rural, mini-grid energy generators to monetize the full capacity of their output as a buyer of last resort, as well as serving as an anchor tenant for new energy generation creation.[^386]

This makes power development in Africa safer and more economical for the developer, and thus helps projects become built rather than remain in development limbo. In late 2022, the companyÂ raised \$2 million in venture capitalÂ to expand their operations. As *Bitcoin Magazine* reported:

> In its first year of operation, Gridless has entered five different project contract pilots in rural Kenya alongside HydroBox, an African hydroelectric energy company. Three of these pilots are now operational. Gridless finances the construction and managers the operation of the data centers in these rural communities. The company has now set its sights on expansion into other areas in East Africa.[^387]

A bitcoin-focused entrepreneur, Obi Nwosu, described these locations as being "frontier towns" in 2022, referencing the towns that sprung up around gold mining locations in the 1800s as people settled west across North America. Bitcoin mining can incentivize the production of otherwise untapped sources of power --- such as small rivers --- and can make microgrids more economically viable. Once developed, these power sources provide opportunities for people to come live and work in that area, starting with the power or datacenter workers, extending to their families, extending further to support services, and expanding out from there into full-fledged villages. With an operational microgrid in place, the area can become more productive and thus wealthier, which enables people to afford more devices and consume more power, and enjoy a higher quality of life.

**A Pro-Energy Technology**

It\'s unintuitive to most people that energy is not fungible. This is true for certain types of hydrocarbons such as stranded natural gas, but it's especially applicable to electrical power. Electrical power is produced at a specific time and place and can't be transported very far without heavy losses. Certain sources of variable power such as solar panels and wind turbines produce excess electricity at certain times, which is curtailed (e.g., dissipated as waste heat). Certain sources of always-on sources of power such as hydroelectric dams often have insufficient electrical demand installed around them, or have variable demand, and thus that electrical generation is wasted as well. People often imagine every unit of electricity generation being put to productive use, and that every new source of electricity demand must directly compete with some existing source of electricity demand. However, as this chapter described, a considerable amount of electricity is wasted, due to the lack of a sufficiently flexible buyer to come and pay a marginal cost for it.

When the tractor was invented, it allowed one person to do the work of what had previously required a dozen people to do. Tractors, however, required additional energy in the form of hydrocarbons. If we analyze them based on external energy usage alone, then we will conclude that it is a more energy-intensive farming practice than farming by manual labor. However, upon deeper analysis, we can see that this energy usage replaces all the caloric energy of those farmers and frees up their invaluable time and energy to produce other things.

Likewise, Bitcoin uses energy, but by doing so it can maintain and update a global ledger in a decentralized, automated way, compared to current banking ledgers that rely on centralized and often manual processes based on trust. And compared to proof-of-stake networks, Bitcoin does this in a way that preserves the concept of unforgeable costliness, meaning that even if the network temporarily goes down, the history of the ledger can't be faked or argued over. In other words, Bitcoin adds energy into the process to minimize how much governance is required. If a digitally native monetary network like Bitcoin becomes more widely used, then the legacy finance industry doesn't need to be as large and resource intensive as it is now.

Any company mentioned in this chapter is subject to risk, and therefore to potential failure. Over multi-year periods, many startup companies fail.

However, even as specific companies may come and go, the novel way in which the network consumes energy leads to many interesting possibilities. The world has never had such a flexible consumer of energy before in terms of both the location and intermittency of that energy. If the Bitcoin network continues to prosper and use energy, then various inefficiencies in our existing energy production can be stabilized and put to economic use. In addition, various sources of clean energy that are otherwise far from existing human settlement can be profitably tapped into, which incentivizes people to move to them.
