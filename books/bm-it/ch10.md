# Chapter 7: **Free Banking vs Central Banking**

Over centuries, various banking models have been used. For the purposes of this chapter we can divide national banking systems into two types: free banking and central banking.

The banks described in the prior chapter were examples of free banks. Free banks hold base money (such as gold) and have liabilities to the depositors that represent claims on that money. They also may issue banknotes that represent claims on that money, which serve as bearer assets that are not assigned to any individual but instead give the bearer (holder) of the banknote access to the base money. Individual banknotes will often be passed around as bearer asset currency, and only occasionally used to withdraw the base money from the bank.[^107]

Figure 7-A shows an example of a full reserve, gold-backed free banking system.

In most contexts, however, free banks used a fractional reserve model. They collected gold deposits, held some of that gold in their vault, and lent some of the gold out for interest. Due to generating profit on the deposits via lending, the bank can waive fees or pay interest to depositors. This increases risks for the bank and the depositors, because if too many people want their gold back at once, the bank will have to suspend withdrawals. [^108]

Figure 7-B shows an example of a 50% fractional reserve, gold-backed free banking system.

The answer to "who controls the ledger?" in this scenario is a combination of nature and individual banks. In a free banking system based on gold or some other natural base money, the amount of base money in the country is determined by the forces of geology and international trade. The supply of gold may be expanded with the discovery of new deposits (such as was the case for the California gold rush). Alternatively, the supply of gold may be expanded or reduced by running trade surpluses or trade deficits respectively. If the people of a country in aggregate continually buy more than they sell to people in foreign nations, then the country will run a structural trade deficit, and gold will continually flow out of the country and into the coffers of its foreign trading partners. If a country is highly productive, and people in it sell more goods and services to foreign nations than they buy, then the country will run a structural trade surplus, and gold will continually flow into the country.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, free banking was prevalent in many countries. It was particularly successful in Canada, Sweden, and Scotland despite relying on duration mismatching. The turbulent free banking era in the United States from the 1830s to the 1860s was filled with numerous bank failures and is often pointed to as evidence for the failure of free banking as a concept, but this was a small and troubled time in the bigger and more global history of free banking that generally can be described as having a mixed success rate. George Selgin's 1988 book on the theory of free banking provided useful research into 19th-century free banking practices.[^109] Selgin went on to provide decades of additional research in the form of books and scholarly articles on the subject to the present day.

In his book on the history of money, Glyn Davies listed examples of different free bank regulations on a state-by-state basis. Massachusetts allowed nearly anyone to create a bank, and with minimal requirements. New York had more stringent requirements, with various capital requirements along with the necessity to keep a reserve of precious metal coins equal to at least 12.5% of circulating banknotes. Louisiana had a tighter requirement of reserving banknotes with at least one-third precious metal coins in reserve for circulating banknotes, along with other capital and liquidity regulations.[^110]

In contrast to free banking, central banking standardizes and centralizes the national ledger and the banknotes. In this type of system, a central bank is recognized or established by the government, and each bank uses the central bank's ledger as its base money. Rather than holding their reserves as vaulted gold, they hold their reserves as entries on a central bank's ledger, and the central bank (or its government) holds the gold --- assuming for the moment that the system is still gold-backed, as it once was. The central bank replaces individual banks as the issuer of banknotes.[^111]

The central bank itself has both assets and liabilities. Their liabilities are primarily the reserves that individual banks store with them, as well as all the banknotes in circulation that are issued by the central bank. The assets can vary depending on the period of history. They might have gold as their primary assets, for example. In the modern fiat era, central banks use government bonds as their primary assets.

Figure 7-C shows an example of a fractional reserve, gold-backed central banking system.

Figure 7‑C

In this framework, the central bank mainly determines the amount of base money (the sum of physical currency and bank reserves) in the system. If there is a crisis, the central bank can create more base money, and can serve as a lender of last resort due to this flexibility. Specifically, they have some flexibility regarding how much of their base money is backed by physical gold, if the system is functioning pretty well. In many contexts during the late 19th century and early 20th century, central banks would be mandated to have at least 35% or 40% gold backing, and therefore tried to keep the number above the required threshold most of the time.[^112] In simplified terms: if too many people pulled gold out of the system, a central bank could raise interest rates (more specifically "discount rates") to entice some of that gold to be deposited back in --- either domestically or from abroad. If a central bank had plenty of gold on hand, they could cut interest rates (discount rates) to stimulate credit growth and economic expansion.

Central banking consists of several layers of abstraction and centralization. Individual depositors in banks are powerless within this type of system. Each bank is also effectively powerless because all its assets consist of IOUs. The central bank holds all the power, and a central bank can be controlled by the government. When we ask our recurring question --- "who controls the ledger?" --- we can see that the answer to this question changes a bit between free banking and central banking.

In a gold-backed free banking system, the answer is that nature and individual banks control the ledger, with the government in turn having the option to influence or take over banks to varying degrees. The properties of nature continue to provide scarcity for the underlying precious metal, and people can still directly hold precious metal coins, bars, and jewelry. To the extent that they deposit funds into a bank, that bank controls that part of the ledger.

In a gold-backed central banking system, the answer is that nature still provides scarcity for the underlying precious metal, but it's becoming increasingly removed from everyday operation of the system. Individual banks are barely in control anymore, because rather than vaulting gold directly, they store their reserves as entries on the central bank ledger. They can lose funds (including customer deposits) by making bad loans, but they have no agency over the value of their own reserves, since they have a layer of abstraction between themselves and the underlying metal. The central bank now controls the ledger for deposits and their underlying reserves throughout the country. The only control that individuals retain is the portion that they hold themselves in precious metal coins.

**A Brisk Walk Through American Monetary History**

Banking systems have trended toward centralization over time. This happened in various European countries, and then the United States and other countries went through a similar process. The rather recent and continuous history of the United States provides a useful walkthrough for how this centralization tends to happen.

The founding of the United States and its monetary system happened in phases. The Revolutionary War began in 1775, and the Declaration of Independence was written in 1776. During the war era, the Continental Congress issued banknotes called Continentals, which eventually hyperinflated.[^113] The Constitution went into effect in 1789. The Coinage Act of 1792 made the silver dollar the base unit of account in the United States and established the U.S. Mint to issue standardized legal tender coinage. Within that Coinage Act, a silver dollar was established to be equivalent to 371.25 grain (24.1 grams) silver. A tri-metallic decimal system was structured around it as follows:

- Eagles: 247.5 grain of gold, denominated as \$10.00.

- Half eagles: 123.75 grain of gold, denominated as \$5.00.

- Quarter eagles: 61.875 grain of gold, denominated as \$2.50.

- Dollars: 371.25 grain of silver, denominated as \$1.00.

- Half dollars: 185.625 grain of silver, denominated as \$0.50.

- Quarter dollars: 92.8125 grain of silver, denominated as \$0.25.

- Dimes: 37.125 grain of silver, denominated as \$0.10.

- Half dimes: 18.5625 grain of silver, denominated as \$0.05.

- Cents: 264 grain of copper, denominated as \$0.01.

- Half cents: 132 grain of copper, denominated as \$0.005.[^114]

The First Bank of the United States was established in 1791, but it was not a true central bank, and was limited in its scope due to the deeply embedded controversy about having a central bank at the time. It had a finite charter of 20 years which expired in 1811. In 1816, the Second Bank of the United States was established, similarly limited in scope, and lasted for another 20 years until 1836.[^115]

Various commercial banks existed at this time; they could issue banknotes and used precious metals and other assets as reserves that those banknotes were redeemable for. So, while the government's role was to standardize and produce coinage for the national unit of account, it left the issuance of paper banknotes to individual banks. Any money put into circulation by the government itself was limited by the availability of precious metals; they couldn't just create money out of thin air. Banks could use various types of collateral for their banknotes, but to be credible they had to be able to honor redemptions of banknotes for precious metals on demand.

States regulated the individual banks within their jurisdictions. There is often a lot of corruption in terms of who gets to run a bank, because it's very lucrative to be one of the entities allowed to issue fractionally reserved banknotes. Branching was often limited or disallowed, meaning that a bank could not open several different branches in several different states. This prevented banks from diversifying their deposits and loans properly across geographies, and thus they were quite prone to bank runs and various liquidity and solvency crises. Compared to Canada, Sweden, and Scotland, free banking in the United States was a lot more restricted, and these individual banks in aggregate were not very safe outside of certain jurisdictions.[^116]

In the 1860s, under President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War, the country began to centralize its banking system. The National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864 established a set of national banks with stricter regulations, established a national paper currency issued by national banks that were backed up partially by government bonds, and expanded the ability of the federal government to issue war bonds. Each national bank, as part of its setup process, had to buy government bonds and deposit them with the Comptroller of the Currency. Further legislation in 1865 effectively taxed state banknotes out of existence, establishing the national banknotes as the near monopoly on currency issuance.[^117]

To fund the American Civil War in the 1860s, the U.S. federal government began issuing "greenbacks" as fiat currency --- first in the form of demand notes and then in the form of United States notes. At this point, the U.S. federal government was engaging in seigniorage --- it could issue currency and debt for nearly zero cost. This gave them the ability to absorb savings from the population (as long as they could retain some degree of credibility and reputation) and channel those savings toward the war effort. While their valuations relative to gold did fluctuate, the monetary properties of the greenbacks were managed better than the Continentals and avoided hyperinflation. On the other side of the war, the Confederate States of America also issued fiat currency to channel peoples' savings toward the war, and their currency went on to hyperinflate due to their loss in the war.[^118]

After the war ended, a multi-decade disagreement between creditors and debtors emerged. Creditors, referring especially to the wealthier financial class centered in the Northeast, wanted to tighten the money supply as much as possible, including retiring the fiat greenbacks and demonetizing silver, so that the dollar would only be pegged to gold. Debtors, referring to farmers and certain other working-class groups and organizing under the "Free Silver" movement, tended to be more in favor of keeping the greenbacks in circulation and maintaining both gold and silver as money, which would allow for a larger supply of dollars.[^119] This brought to attention an important issue: dollars were merely an abstraction of value, redeemable for *something* of value which meant that the definition of a dollar could change in a political group's favor by shrinking or expanding its supply. Savers and creditors of dollars will naturally want a stronger dollar; debtors that owe dollars will naturally want a weaker dollar. In this case the hard money side won; the Coinage Act of 1873 and the Gold Standard Act of 1900 demonetized silver and set the country on a gold standard until 1933.

Much analysis on inflation decries the printing of money by governments and central banks, and indeed money-printing is something that occurs frequently in the modern era. But similar attention must be paid to the centralized destruction of money as well. When savers save money in a unit of account that they expect to be stable, and that unit of account is rapidly printed or redefined to be weaker by a central authority (reduced in terms of purchasing power), then it is basically a breach of contract for savers. Conversely, when debtors borrow money in a unit of account that they expect to be stable, and that unit of account is rapidly destroyed or redefined to be stronger by a central authority (increased in terms of purchasing power), than it is likewise a breach of contract for debtors.

With the 1913 Federal Reserve Act a third national bank of the United States was established, and the first true central bank of the country: the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve was constructed as a system of twelve Federal Reserve banks, which are owned by commercial banks but are overseen by a board of federally appointed officials. The Act gave the Federal Reserve authority to oversee the banking system, serve as lender of last resort, and issue Federal Reserve banknotes. The Federal Reserve held gold among its assets and administered the ledger that served as the monetary base for the country, with commercial banks storing their reserves as entries on the Federal Reserve's ledger.[^120]

During the Great Depression in 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102, which made it a criminal offense, punishable by up to ten years in prison, for Americans to own gold anywhere in the world other than small amounts for things like wedding rings. People were told to hand over their gold and were given the existing pegged exchange rate of 20.67 dollars per ounce in return. In the next year, the 1934 Gold Reserve Act barred all banks from redeeming dollars for gold and required the Federal Reserve to hand over all its gold to the United States Treasury. Through the combination of these actions, large amounts of gold were handed over by the public to the U.S. federal government in exchange for paper dollars and bank deposits.

After the 1934 Gold Reserve Act, the federal government then sharply devalued the dollar relative to gold. An ounce of gold went from being worth 20.67 dollars to 35 dollars. This allowed them to expand the monetary base in dollar terms relative to their amount of gold reserves, and thus devalue peoples' dollar-denominated savings --- as well as devalue various debts, including the federal debt. The federal government constructed the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox and transferred their gold to that location.[^121]

Although it was illegal for Americans to own gold for approximately four decades, many of them secretly did, and the ban wasn't very enforceable in practice. It's easy for a government to get all the gold out of banks with the stroke of a pen, but to get all the smaller amounts of gold out of individual households would require a much more expensive and draconian operation. They had to be content with getting a significant percentage of it, mainly from banks and from individuals who willingly turned it over early on to avoid the low chance of getting caught.

From 1933 until 1971, dollars were still redeemable for gold by foreign central banks at this new devalued rate, but not by American citizens, and not by foreign private entities. In 1971, the United States defaulted on foreign redemption as well, and rendered the dollar redeemable for nothing. After that point, the dollar's fall in value accelerated. By the 1980s and 1990s, an ounce of gold was worth approximately ten times as many dollars (\$300 to \$400 depending on the year) as it used to be, as dollars were rapidly debased. By the 2010s and 2020s, an ounce of gold was worth well over \$1,000 and at times reached over \$2,000.

Figure 7-D shows the change in purchasing power of the U.S. dollar over time as measured by aggregate price inflation, with key moments annotated.

Figure 7‑D

As Figure 7-D shows, the War of 1812 and the 1860s Civil War resulted in temporary debasement, but due to the success in those wars, national productivity, and the underlying dollar-to-gold peg, the debasement reversed back to the prior value.[^122] Starting in 1913 with the creation of the Federal Reserve, followed up by the World Wars, the 1933 elimination of domestic gold redeemability, and then again with the 1971 elimination of international gold redeemability, the dollar sharply fell out of that historical range. And yet despite all of that, the U.S. dollar was the second-best performing currency in the world during this timeframe; most currencies lost value even more quickly.

During the period where the dollar was stable in value, it was fine for people to hold physical banknotes from high-quality banks for long periods of time since they didn't have to worry about persistent devaluation. Putting deposits into a bank to collect interest was optional, rather than a necessity. However, in the post-1913 world and especially in the post-1971 world, as dollars began losing value more continuously and rapidly, it became untenable to hold large amounts of banknotes outside of banks due to their continual loss of purchasing power. If a saver had any hope of keeping up with inflation, it became necessary to deposit money in banks and collect interest. Bank deposits underperformed inflation from 1913 to the present, but at least underperformed *less* than holding physical banknotes that paid no interest. Therefore, this structurally inflationary system enhanced the power of banks by making them more necessary for everyone to deposit the bulk of their savings with. It also increased the power of the government to surveil account balances and transactions, collect taxes, and freeze funds on demand, since most of the money was in the banks rather than in the form of physical and private bearer assets. Put simply, an inflationary money necessitates the use of counterparties and leverage to try to keep up with inflation by earning interest, which is not the case with a hard money.

In 1970, Congress passed the Bank Secrecy Act, which made banks file reports to the government whenever their customers do more than \$10,000 in transactions within a day. Back then, this dollar amount was worth more than the median annual income, and reporting therefore happened rather infrequently. However, the Bank Secrecy Act was not adjusted for inflation, and so over the course of five decades, the government has automatically reduced the threshold for necessary reporting and has therefore continually expanded their surveillance mandate each year without further legislation. The combination of restricting the number of physical banknotes in circulation, making it undesirable to hold physical banknotes for long periods of time due to inflation without interest, and surveilling bank deposits, has been an effective surveillance and control combination.

Figure 7-E shows a simplified version of what the system looks like now, with gold replaced by Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as the Federal Reserve's primary assets.

Figure 7-E

The combination of these actions shows why the question of "who controls the ledger" is very important. It also shows how quickly the answer to the question can change.

When people hold precious metals directly, they rely on nature to administer their ledger, since it is mainly the scarcity of the metal available for humans to mine economically that determines to what extent their savings can retain their purchasing power. In addition, people can hand these precious metals to other people, which allows for private, censorship-resistant transactions that don't depend on counterparties. People are, however, vulnerable to physical theft to whatever extent they custody their own coins at home.

When people deposit some of their funds into custodians or free banks that vault some of their gold, they are now relying on both nature and that bank to administer the ledger. The user must trust the scarcity of gold itself and must trust the bank not to mismanage their loan book or to commit fraud. The user also gives up their privacy; their banker knows their wealth and who they deal with; and their government knows their wealth and who they deal with; and both have the power to seize their funds if desired. In exchange, the user gets more convenience including fast, long-distance transaction capabilities. The user can still hold some gold or silver in their own custody, and therefore can decide how to manage the risk/reward of holding their money with themselves and with their bank.

Any time that balances are defined in a unit of account that is pegged to something else, then the authorities who control that peg can determine the fate of both savers and debtors. Changing the rules for that unit to peg it to something scarcer can dramatically harm debtors. Likewise, changing the rules to peg it to something more abundant can dramatically harm savers.

When the government establishes a central bank, and especially if it outlaws gold ownership, it takes monetary power away from the people and gives it almost entirely to banks and government authorities. People at that point have limited ability to custody their own scarce and liquid assets, and instead must rely on the central banking ledger; they must therefore submit to the risks of currency debasement and must give up most of their privacy. Government officials can now more easily take purchasing power away from savers --- not just through transparent taxation but also through non-transparent inflation of the money supply --- and channel it toward their goals. Governments can also more easily surveil and audit everyone's finances.
