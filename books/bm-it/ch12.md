**The Rise and Fall of Global Monetary Orders**

"*By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate* arbitrarily*; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some.*"[^139]

-John Maynard Keynes
