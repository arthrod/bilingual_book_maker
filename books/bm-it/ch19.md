# Chapter 14: **The Modern Financial System**

This part of the book explores the nuts and bolts of the modern financial system. This includes how the system works, how money is created and destroyed, and how its design benefits and hurts certain types of users.

The following chapters together show that the financial system in its current form is designed in such a way that 1) the money supply continually inflates, 2) purchasing power is gradually siphoned away from savers and toward arbitrageurs who sit near the source of money creation, 3) the system rewards large and well-connected entities at the cost of small and poorly-connected entities, 4) liabilities gradually shift from the private sector to the public sector to keep the system from ever clearing out debt, and 5) this process suppresses volatility for a while until most of it comes out all at once.

But, before we get to all that, we need to start at the foundation and work our way up.

**The Federal Reserve System 101**

The financial system consists of a series of nested ledgers. In other words, it's a series of smaller ledgers built upon larger ledgers.

At the foundation of the system in the United States (and to some extent the rest of the world, due to the U.S. dollar's world reserve currency status) is the Federal Reserve System, which serves as the central bank of the United States. The Federal Reserve System (commonly known as "the Federal Reserve" or "the Fed") is a hybrid public/private organization that was created by the U.S. Congress with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and modified several times in further legislation. The Federal Reserve controls the base ledger for the modern financial system.

From the private sector side, the Federal Reserve consists of twelve regional federal reserve banks. These regional federal reserve banks act as the "bankers' banks" for their regions, and they also put paper currency into circulation. The most important of these twelve regional federal reserve banks is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, because it is as large as the other eleven combined, and it performs the Federal Reserve's open market operations. Private sector commercial banks hold stock in these regional federal reserve banks, get to elect most of the reserve banks' board of directors, and receive a dividend yield on their invested capital.[^198]

From the public sector side, there is a seven-member Federal Reserve Board of Governors. These governors are appointed by the president of the United States, confirmed by the Senate, and hold 14-year terms. As an entity, this Board of Governors along with their extensive support staff collectively operates as a federal government agency based in the nation's capital, and they govern the Federal Reserve System. The most important governor is the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, who holds the highest rank in the Federal Reserve. After paying operating expenses and a dividend to member banks, all surplus profits of the Federal Reserve are sent to the U.S. Treasury Department.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the Federal Reserve's body of twelve individuals that meets eight times per year and sets the monetary policy for the nation and, by extension, affects vast portions of the global financial system as well. The seven members of the Board of Governors sit on the FOMC, the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sits on the FOMC, and then the four remaining seats are filled by a rotating subset of the heads of the other eleven regional federal reserve banks. This is designed in such a way that the public sector representation has the majority (seven) of the seats on this committee, and the private sector representation has the minority (five) of the seats.[^199]

**A Layered Stack of IOUs**

The asset side of a typical private sector commercial bank primarily consists of loans, securities, and cash. A mortgage, for example, is a liability for a consumer and an asset for a bank. The bank owns this claim of future dollar payments from the consumer, and the consumer has a liability to pay those dollars to the bank. Other types of loans include business loans, personal loans, credit card loans, student loans, auto loans, margin loans, and so forth. For securities, banks often hold a significant amount of U.S. Treasury securities and other types of bonds. Most of a bank's cash, other than a tiny amount of vault cash that they keep on hand, is held with the Federal Reserve as bank reserves in digital form.

The liability side of a typical private sector bank primarily consists of consumer and business deposits. Individual people and businesses hold checking accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposits at banks. These represent assets for the consumers and businesses, while representing liabilities for the commercial bank. By holding cash at a bank, a depositor is giving that bank a low-interest rate loan.

To remain functional, a bank must have more assets than it has liabilities, must follow strict regulations set by the U.S. federal government and the U.S. Federal Reserve, and its assets should pay higher interest rates than its liabilities, which along with fees is where it generates its profit.

The Federal Reserve's combined balance sheet has both assets and liabilities, much like any normal bank. On the asset side, they own U.S. Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities (ever since the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis), and a small percentage of other assets. On the liability side, all physical banknotes represent direct liabilities of the Federal Reserve, and cash reserves that commercial banks hold in their Federal Reserve accounts are also direct liabilities of the Federal Reserve.

Figure 14-A shows a simplified diagram of the U.S. financial system, representing a chain of assets and liabilities.

At this point, we can notice a potential problem: The whole thing is circular. The financial assets that underpin even the core of the system are themselves liabilities. It's liabilities all the way down.

There's an old joke about a woman claiming that the world rests on a giant turtle. When asked what the giant turtle stands on, she says another giant turtle. When asked what that second giant turtle stands on, she exasperatedly says, "it's turtles all the way down!" Variations of this story trace back to at least 1838, although back then it was rocks rather than turtles.[^200]

If you have a bank account, that's an asset for you and a liability for your bank, and it just consists of an entry in that bank's ledger. That bank account is backed up by the bank's assets, which consist of various borrowers' liabilities to the bank. The bank, meanwhile, stores its excess cash reserves as an asset at the Federal Reserve, which again is just an entry on the Federal Reserve's ledger. These cash reserves, being a liability of the Federal Reserve, are backed up by the Federal Reserve's assets, which primarily consists of U.S. Treasury securities. These U.S. Treasury securities are liabilities of the U.S. federal government and are primarily backed up by the U.S. federal government's tax authority on citizens and businesses within its jurisdiction.

In some sense, the circularity of the financial system is almost poetic; it represents how dependent we all are on one another. However, it's also very fragile. Everything is a claim of a claim of a claim, reliant on perpetual motion and continual growth to not collapse. For such a collapse to happen in the United States seems almost unthinkable to many, but it happens in smaller countries around the world all the time and has happened to big countries in the past.

Importantly, as described in prior chapters, the system wasn't always circular like this. Up until 1913 (and to a certain degree all the way up until 1971) the whole financial system was built on gold and was instead a series of nested claims that ultimately represented the ability to redeem a certain amount of gold. Gold itself is an asset for the holder and a liability for nobody else; it represents the accumulated energy that was used to extract it from the earth and refine it into usable form, for which it has many applications. In that type of gold-backed system, everything is ultimately underpinned by an unencumbered asset, whereas in the current system, everything is ultimately underpinned by government bonds, which are themselves liabilities.

**Fedwire**

When people and businesses send money to each other from their bank accounts, their banks must communicate and settle those transfers behind the scenes. In other words, when you make a payment and it seems finished to you, the banks still have some back-end work to do.

One of the things that banks have historically done is batch many small transactions into a set of bigger transactions. If I give a merchant \$45 using a credit card, and they buy \$27 worth of supplies from another merchant, these little transactions get stored as short-term debt on the books of our financial institutions until they are settled into bigger settlement transactions.

Even various fintech companies that perform fiat currency payments and other services are connected to banking rails, rather than going around banking rails or otherwise competing with banking rails. Banks have accounts with the Federal Reserve, and various fintech companies have accounts at banks or become banks themselves, and so every customer is using banks and these settlement systems without necessarily realizing it.

Until the early 1900s, these large settlements between banks were often performed with the physical transfer of banknotes and gold, via armed transport. In the 1910s decade, the Federal Reserve began using a Morse code system to minimize the need for that type of physical transport. Banks, storing their reserves at the Federal Reserve as an entry on the Federal Reserve's ledger, could settle with each other using a secure telecommunication system, and the Federal Reserve would simply update the reserve ledger to acknowledge the fact that one of its member banks sent money to another one of its member banks.[^201]

This settlement system operated by the Federal Reserve has continued to be updated over time and is now known as Fedwire. In 2022, Fedwire processed over \$1.06 quadrillion (\$1,060 trillion) worth of gross settlement volumes for thousands of individual U.S. commercial banks. This consisted of over 196 million settlements averaging \$5.41 million each in size.[^202] When people and businesses send small and medium-sized amounts of money to each other, many of those transactions are ultimately being batched together and settled between banks with these huge settlements.

In 2023, the Federal Reserve developed FedNow, which allows depositors at banks to send money to each other in real time. Banks still serve as middlemen for this operation, and the Federal Reserve moves bank reserves around in the background, but this new system skips over some of the transaction batching services that banks have historically been relied upon to do. As with most banking system updates, FedNow gives more granular surveillance capabilities to the Federal Reserve compared to what they currently have for Fedwire, since they will have more information on individual entity payments between institutions rather than just institutional-level batched settlements.

There is a major secondary settlement system in the United States known as the Clearing House Interbank Payment System or ("CHIPS") which is a private sector alternative. This system is owned by several banks and serves less than 50 large financial institutions out of the thousands that exist, but still processes hundreds of trillions of dollars' worth of volumes per year due to how large of a share of payments that those several dozen institutions account for.[^203] Together, Fedwire and CHIPS perform most of the settlement volume in the United States. Virtually all transactions that we do as individuals and businesses on higher ledgers of the system get settled through those systems at or near the base layer of the system.

**The International Connections**

Other countries have similar setups for their financial systems. What they usually have in common is that they have a central bank that holds the domestic financial system's bank reserves and physical cash as its liabilities (the monetary base), which are underpinned by government debt and other assets. They also operate or facilitate a settlement system between banks. The oldest still-existing central bank is the Riksbank of Sweden, and the second oldest is the Bank of England.

What makes other countries different than the United States is that their central banks also usually tie into the U.S. Federal Reserve System as described in Part 3 of this book, since the U.S. dollar is the current world reserve currency. In addition to holding their own country's debt as part of its assets, a central bank outside of the United States typically holds U.S. Treasury securities as assets as well. They also usually hold some government bonds of other large countries.

Various entities throughout the world including banks, corporations, and governments, often have dollar-denominated debts. As of this writing, the Bank for International Settlements estimates that there is approximately \$13 trillion in dollar-denominated debt held by non-U.S. entities.[^204] However, it\'s important to note that most of this debt is not owed to U.S. entities. Instead, European entities, Japanese entities, Chinese entities, and various international entities often lend to other entities in dollars, even though neither the lender nor the borrower are based in the United States. This is especially the case when lenders in developed countries lend money to entities in developing countries.

For this reason, although the U.S. Federal Reserve primarily operates the centralized domestic ledger for the United States, it effectively operates the main ledger for the world. Nearly 90% of currency exchange volume in the world involves the dollar, nearly 60% of international currency reserves are dollar-denominated, and nearly 50% of global trade invoicing and cross-border loans are denominated in dollars.[^205] All dollars are nested claims on banks that ultimately lead back to claims on the U.S. monetary base, which is the liability side of the Federal Reserve.

Many central banks still hold gold, although gold represents a smaller share of central bank assets than it did in the gold standard era. The global financial system is therefore now rather circular: Central banks hold fiat currency deposits and government bonds from other countries around the world as part of their assets, which are themselves liabilities of other central banks and governments. As a result, financial systems of countries around the world are all tied into this combined global structure, which is in significant part built around the U.S. Federal Reserve System.

Although much faster than the pre-telecommunication era, sending money internationally at scale today is often a slow, expensive, and opaque process by modern standards. Wire transfers often get delayed or cancelled, and it's hard to trace where the problem occurred. This is because such transfers often must hop between several correspondent banks, perform various currency conversions, and rely on trust between banks to varying degrees. The most common payments messaging system between banks is the SWIFT system, which was founded in 1973 and still operates similarly to how it did decades ago. Various fintech companies and money transfer businesses that run on top of banking rails can speed up payments for smaller users, but the average international fee for sending remittances is over 6%.[^206]
