# Chapter 19: **The Long-Term Debt Cycle**

There's a cycle as old as civilization, at the heart of both politics and economics: It's about the exponential accumulation of debt and the inevitable financial resets that occur whenever debt reaches a societal breaking point. The reason the cycle is so old and repetitive is that the exponential nature of financial debt conflicts to some extent with human nature, while also touching on the deep societal questions of what we ultimately owe to each other.

Wealth and debt both tend to concentrate over time within a society. Someone making a low income must spend practically all their income on shelter and sustenance. Once someone can make some surplus income for one reason or another, either due to natural gifts or external good luck and has the temperament and knowledge to compound it, then they can do so exponentially. At that point, wealth begets more wealth. And at a high enough level, wealth can beget more political influence, to shift public finances more toward them, which begets even more wealth. They can also give their children more nutritious food and a top-tier education, along with any investment capital and high-end connections they might need, to start them with an accelerated boost and maintain what is akin to a dynasty that can compound on itself.

In older times, when most people worked in agriculture, failed harvests or other natural catastrophes would often result in them and their family members becoming debt slaves. People stuck in debt slavery often had limited means to ever get a surplus income and get out of their situation. After several failed harvests or other accumulating problems, a greater and greater share of a society would be in debt slavery, either literally or nearly so, while a vanishingly small percentage of people near the top held almost all the assets and credit. After a certain point, this situation risks manifesting itself in societal breakdown because many of those debt slaves can look around, realize how great their numbers are, and initiate a violent revolution. Credit is a human construct and begins to look especially arbitrary to people when it was primarily accumulated by past circumstances and ancestors.[^274] So, if enough people become angry and feel that things are unfairly stacked against them, they can show the handful of owners of that credit how fragile their claims to such credit really are.

In the modern context, now that most people don't work in agriculture anymore, we can identify various new ways people get stuck in debt traps. It could be as basic as a medical debt that compounds over time. It could be that they took out too much student debt as a teenager, couldn't get an income large enough to offset it, and thus are stuck with it for decades (and in some jurisdictions, student debt is not dischargeable even in bankruptcy, unlike most other forms of debt).[^275]

For a poor person, banking ironically gets more expensive too; they run into overdraft fees as well as fees for having a low account balance, while the wealthy are rewarded with waived fees and extensive rewards[^276]. Any loans that a poor person may take out to make ends meet, such as payday loans or credit card loans, come at incredibly high interest rates, while the wealthy can borrow at cheaper rates. Furthermore, people who are poor in wealth often become poor in time as well; they have more frictions and time sinks throughout their day to achieve the same tasks (no car, no childcare, no in-home laundry machines or dishwashers, and so forth). Even basic things like tickets for various violations, being at a flat rate in most jurisdictions, are irrelevant for the wealthy while being financially damaging for the poor. If impoverished people can't pay tickets, some jurisdictions put them in jail, and then charge them for their jail stay, which further disrupts their finances both in terms of time and money and the ability to earn an income. In developing countries, a considerable percentage of people don't even have access to a bank account, since bank accounts have substantial overhead costs and aren't economical for tiny balances. So, many of these people stash what little savings they have in physical currency under their mattress, which keeps getting debased without being offset by interest payments that bank account holders receive.

Debt and poverty have an exponentially compounding aspect to them, sending people ever lower, while credit and wealth have an exponentially compounding aspect in the other direction, sending people ever higher. Peoples' instincts and ways of interpreting the world are generally linear while compounding is exponential, and this mismatch tends to break all our societal models over time.

However, if violent revolution occurs, it is more often the case that poverty is redistributed upwards rather than wealth being redistributed downwards. Rather than the poor becoming wealthy, the wealthy become newly poor alongside the existing poor. The wealthy are overthrown, but along with them the whole system risks being plunged into chaos, and the fragile set of economic incentives risks being destroyed. For the most part, the only people who become wealthier from this process are the handful of leaders of the new regime.

For this reason, kings have been performing periodic partial debt jubilees on a regular basis stretching back to Hammurabi of Babylon and before, as well as other periods and places throughout antiquity. The goal is to partially reset the playing field occasionally before the playing field completely breaks.[^277] A technical analogy is that if you leave a computer on long enough, "memory leaks" gradually build up until there is no unencumbered memory left, and the computer crashes. Restarting the computer frees up the unencumbered memory and starts the system anew. If the computer is left on long enough with no response by the user as it starts to slow down and become buggy, it can eventually crash while the user is in the middle of work and lose unsaved data, which can be quite damaging. On the other hand, performing a more proactive reset occasionally or when early signs of the problem begin to arise, can minimize the disruption that a computer crash would cause.

In their book *Lessons of History*, Will and Ariel Durant ended their chapter on economics and history as follows:

> We conclude that the concentration of wealth is natural and inevitable, and is periodically alleviated by violent or peaceable partial redistribution. In this view all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of concentrating wealth and compulsive recirculation.[^278]

As a way of opting for peaceable partial redistribution rather than risking violent revolution, some civilizations historically encoded this process into their laws or traditions on a regular basis. The Hammurabi Code, for example set limits on debt-slavery durations:

> If any one fail to meet a claim for debt, and sell himself, his wife, his son, and daughter for money or give them away to forced labor: they shall work for three years in the house of the man who bought them, or the proprietor, and in the fourth year they shall be set free.[^279]

Furthermore, Babylonian kings would often forgive all consumer debts when taking power after the death or abdication of a predecessor. Certain business debts and so forth would remain in effect, but consumer loans to everyday people would be wiped clean, and debt slaves set free, often with a celebration and a literal breaking of the clay ledgers.

Recurring debt cancellation shows up in Deuteronomy 15 as well:

> At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the Lord's time for canceling debts has been proclaimed. You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you. \[\...\] If any of your people --- Hebrew men or women --- sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed. Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you.[^280]

In *Lessons of History*, Will and Ariel Durant identified an example of a partial reset from Ancient Greece:

> In the Athens of 594 B.C., according to Plutarch, 'the disparity of fortune between the rich and the poor had reached its height, so that the city seemed to be in a dangerous condition, and no other means for freeing it from disturbances seemed possible but despotic power.' The poor, finding their status worsened with each year- the government in the hands of their masters, and the corrupt courts deciding every issue against them- began to talk of violent revolt. The rich, angry at the challenge to their property, prepared to defend themselves by force. Good sense prevailed; moderate elements secured the election of Solon, a businessman of aristocratic lineage, to the supreme archonship. He devalued the currency, thereby easing the burden of all debtors (although he himself was a creditor); he reduced all personal debts, and ended imprisonment for debt; he cancelled arrears for taxes and mortgage interest, he established a graduated income tax that made the rich pay at a rate twelve times that required of the poor; he reorganized the courts on a more popular basis; he arranged that the sons of those who had died in war for Athens should be brought up and educated at the government's expense. The rich protested that his measures were outright confiscation; the radicals complained that he had not redivided the land; but within a generation almost all agreed that his reforms had saved Athens from revolution.[^281]

I've always found that Greek description interesting, because if the names are replaced, we can imagine modern-day politicians taking both sides in that debate. Those who hold the credit (or represent those who do) generally want to preserve the sanctity of credit and the idea of paying one's debts through personal responsibility, strong property rights and hard money policies. Those who owe the debts (or represent those who do) generally point to the structural injustices in the system and the self-reinforcing corruption of those at the top, thanks to the combination of business and political power coming together. Both sides have a point but often talk past each other, because they have a linear perspective on the world in face of the cold hard math of exponential compounding. And to the extent that they can't resolve the situation due to unworkable differences, they eventually risk getting violent revolution instead, where almost nobody wins. The wealthy find out that without broad societal agreement, their fragile claims on a highly interdependent society don't amount to much. The poor find out that merely taking from the wealthy does not make themselves wealthy in their place.

The most productive discussions seem to occur between those who appeal to the other side's rational self-interest. Someone representing debtors, for example, can argue that having broad access to education, healthcare, and some financial breathing room among the public results in more overall productivity and growth for the economy. A small bit of investment or relief from the creditors in the short term, in other words, can pay for itself many times over with a larger economic pie, less crime, and more societal harmony that makes even those creditors wealthier and happier in the long term. Someone representing the creditors, meanwhile, can argue that although such relief can be provided to a certain extent, that core incentive structures of business and profit and property rights must be preserved; naïve thoughts on complete wealth equality or total redistribution are better off discarded, lest they lead to even more widespread poverty and misery for those that are already indebted, by destroying all the necessary economic incentives that lead to the efficient production of goods and services.

In addition to credit compounding exponentially, laws tend to compound as well. Politicians pass more and more laws and regulations over time, and often with an emphasis on favoring those who are in power and are donating to them. Even well-meaning politicians often want to fix things with new laws, but one problem is that old laws are rarely erased; instead, they tend to stack on top of each other, making it more and more burdensome for businesses to understand and work within their boundaries. As a result, administrative overhead expands, tax accounting expands, and productivity decreases. That's not to say that regulations are bad per se, but that layers of regulations that trend toward ever more complexity are unsustainable. Historically, during major credit-clearing cycles, there tend to also be legal-clearing cycles, which further increases the danger of such a point in history because everything is up for being rewritten.

Some societies --- whether it's Babylon four thousand years ago, Athens in the sixth century B.C., or the United States in the 1930s and 1940s --- manage to navigate these pivotal moments in a way that avoids violent revolution, partially resets the board, and keeps the existing incentive structures intact and functioning well. Other societies don't, and failing to find that type of compromise often leads to much darker outcomes, such as the Russian Revolution of 1917.

**Short-Term Fiat Currency Business Cycles**

Most readers of this book will be familiar with the cyclical ebbs and flows of the modern economy, which have been discussed in earlier chapters. Many people debate their causes, including to what extent they are natural and inevitable and to what extent they are caused by central bank policy mistakes, but either way, we know they exist and that we have experienced many of them.

At the start of an economic expansion, businesses and consumers start to recover from the previous economic contraction, and so they begin to take on more debt and risk. This is often because central banks have cut interest rates and provided extra assurances and liquidity to institutions, to encourage more borrowing and lending. As the expansion progresses, this higher and higher level of debt and eventual over-investment (from businesses) and overconsumption (from households) make them increasingly leveraged and fragile. Asset prices generally move from being cheap to being expensive during this process as well. By the end of the cycle, a lot of investments are not very sober-minded, and are based on unrealistic growth expectations and euphoria, and so resources become utilized less productively. By this point, the economy is likely running very hot, and a central bank is likely to be raising interest rates, which can pop the credit bubble that they themselves contributed to at the start of the cycle.

Eventually, some negative catalyst (such as an external shock or a self-imposed central bank policy error), combined with the elevated debt levels and malinvestments, triggers an economic contraction and period of deleveraging. Businesses, facing weaker revenues, reduce their number of employees, which means fewer people have money to spend on other businesses, which can lead businesses to reduce their employee numbers even more. Policymakers usually respond by offering lower interest rates and liquidity provisions to well-connected borrowers, along with fiscal stimulus to offset this otherwise deflationary period. Some defaults occur, the system cleans out some of the excesses of malinvestment and unproductive leverage, and then the cycle starts anew.

A problem is that in a centralized fiat currency system, where policymakers have a lot of flexibility over the base layer of the system, deleveraging is rarely allowed to reduce debt levels all the way back to where they started in the cycle. As the deleveraging begins to occur, fiscal lawmakers and monetary policymakers respond with stimulus to get the next economic expansion started as quickly as possible. By the time the dust settles on a short-term deleveraging event, businesses will have collectively reduced some of their debt, but still have more debt than when they started the previous short-term cycle. Monetary policymakers at this point have cut interest rates and provided liquidity to try to encourage more credit growth again.[^282]

In 1987, stocks crashed unusually sharply. The leaders of the Federal Reserve backstopped it with liquidity arrangements and had various phone calls with commercial banks to give them assurances, with the goal of avoiding a broader credit contagion. In 1998, an extremely large and leveraged hedge fund called Long-Term Capital Management blew up from bad bets, and the Federal Reserve provided liquidity arrangements, cut interest rates, and coordinated a bailout for the hedge fund among 14 banks to avoid a broader credit contagion. This 1998 liquidity backstop contributed to the subsequent two-year parabolic blow-off top in equities during the 2000 dot-com bubble. In the recessionary aftermath of the unwinding of that dot-com bubble, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates down to 1%, which subsequently encouraged massive borrowing and speculation in the housing market over the next several years, which then blew up in 2008 after years of excesses. Throughout this multi-decade process, excess credit was never allowed to clear naturally, and it was repeatedly backstopped and pushed ever higher.

Figure 19-A shows U.S. business cycles over the past five decades up until right before the COVID-19 crisis. Corporate debt as a percentage of GDP decreased during recessions but kept making higher lows and higher highs, and this is in significant part because interest rates reach lower and lower in each cycle and allow for that increased debt accumulation over time. This is driven in part by monetary policymakers.

![](media/image36.png){width="4.5in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 19-A[^283]

Federal debt accumulation, meanwhile, tends to run countercyclically to this trend. Federal debt increases swiftly during recessions, because tax revenues fall due to lower economic output, and federal spending increases to offer extra unemployment benefits and other fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, the United States engaged in the "War on Terror" which more-so than prior wars was financed by debt.

![](media/image37.png){width="4.5in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 19-B[^284]

If the government is trying to smooth out economic growth via countercyclical policies in a sustainable way, then in that framework the government should run a surplus and build a reserve during an economic expansion and then run a deficit from that reserve during a contraction, so that over the course of a full cycle the budget is balanced but is also flexible. In reality, due to the incentive structure that politicians operate under, they run fiscal deficits almost all the time. There's little or no political incentive to run a surplus in any near term, and so it is rarely ever done. Therefore, public debt relative to the size of the economy normally moves mildly upward even during times of strong economic growth, and then further accelerates upward during recessions. Meanwhile, whenever private sector debt risks contracting even mildly, monetary policymakers step in to stop that from happening too broadly.

Figure 19-C shows total U.S. debt (public and private combined) from the start of 1952 (\$461 billion) to the end of 2022 (\$93.5 trillion). The reader can see the smooth, tightly curated trend upwards. Throughout this entire seven-decade period, the total amount of debt in the system was never allowed to decrease, except for a brief period amid the massive 2008 financial crisis where it managed to fall by just 1.3% before continuing its smooth, ever-higher, trend.

Figure 19-C[^285]

This again brings up my theme regarding the gap between the speed of commerce and the speed of settlement that has existed since the second half of the 19th century, starting with the invention of intercontinental telecommunication systems, and continuing through to the present day. Rather than blaming individual politicians for handling the budgets of countries poorly or blaming individual central bankers for handling private sector credit poorly, I instead point mainly toward sound money principals being nearly impossible to implement with the current level of monetary technology that we've had over the past century and a half. With the ability for central banks to print fiat currency as needed, and the speed of hard physical monies (e.g., gold) being too slow to present a realistic alternative payment system compared to fiat currency ledgers, it inevitably shifted political incentives toward constant fiscal deficits, constant credit growth, and constant currency devaluation, with little or no recourse for those who disliked this situation.

As far as the probability of perpetual debt growth is concerned, it hardly matters who is in charge.[^286] Even if a politician were to be genuinely concerned about government debts and deficits and campaign on this topic, they wouldn't get very far in politics and wouldn't be well liked by the broad public if they were to implement their preferred policies in office. They usually wouldn't even be able to get broad enough support among fellow politicians or the broad public to begin implementing them. Meanwhile, the same thing happens to central bankers. Alan Greenspan, serving as the chairman of the Federal Reserve System from 1987 to 2006, was a significant gold enthusiast before his long tenure at the Federal Reserve, and yet during his tenure he promoted smooth and ever-rising debt growth even more than other Federal Reserve leaders. While we can of course blame partially corrupt individual politicians, instances of crony capitalism, and selective bailouts to well-connected entities financed by money-printing, the underlying problem is that all the incentives that are currently in place tend to filter this type of behavior to the top of the system, over and over.

Combining this all together, the modern economy is incentivized to build a string of several short-term business cycles over the course of decades that result in higher and higher government, corporate, and household debt levels relative to the size of the economy. This can occur until interest rates reach zero (or even slightly negative) and policymakers run out of fuel to encourage more and more credit growth. At that point, something different and bigger happens.

**Long-Term Fiat Currency Debt Cycles**

In 2008, banks across the United States began to collapse, and the entire financial system was beginning to fracture down to its foundation. The Federal Reserve dropped interest rates all the way to zero for the first time in generations, but even that wasn't nearly enough. They subsequently stepped in with an unprecedented number of emergency actions, and quickly doubled the entire monetary base within the course of a year.[^287] Meanwhile, Congress stepped in with emergency fiscal bailouts and loans to keep vast portions of the financial system from becoming insolvent at once.[^288]

On the surface, this occurred because many banks made risky loans, packaged them together into opaque securities, and had them stamped with perfect credit ratings by badly incentivized credit rating agencies, which allowed those opaque securities filled with bad loans to be levered up even more. But how could a few years of a housing boom and silly lending and securitization processes lead to a financial calamity of this scale? The answer is that there was a lot more going on underneath, which had been building through decades of prior short-term business cycles, and these excessive behaviors were merely coming to the surface.

At the end of 2007, there was \$52.7 trillion in total U.S. debt, spread between federal debt, state debt, corporate debt, household debt, and other sorts of debt. This was all on a monetary base of just \$837 billion. Each dollar of debt represents a claim to be paid dollars in the future, and in 2007, there was 63 times as much debt in the system as there was base money.

![](media/image39.png){width="4.5in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 19-D[^289]

When debt is that high relative to the monetary base, the whole financial system is like a game of musical chairs that can never be allowed to stop. All of the IOUs that people have are just that --- IOUs (and highly leveraged ones at that). Imagine a game of musical chairs with 63 children for every one chair, and then imagine the calamity that would ensue if it were all allowed to be marked to market at once, by turning the music off and seeing 62 kids become unable to get seats.

When looked at from a narrower angle, even just the banking system had 23 dollars of bank deposit liabilities for every dollar in bank cash. Each of those deposits represented an IOU for a dollar, and yet the banks had very few dollars and instead had a lot of riskier and less liquid loans as their primary assets to back up those IOUs. They relied on their continued ability to borrow money from other banks when needed to meet liquidity requirements, which only works in a smoothly operating environment of banks that trust each other. In other words, as long as the music is playing such a highly leveraged system can function, but as soon as the music stops the inherent fragility is revealed.

![](media/image2.png){width="4.5in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 19-E[^290]

We can see by these numbers and charts that the problem wasn't just a series of bad decisions by banks between 2004 and 2007, although that was a part of it. Instead, the problem had been structurally building for decades, through multiple shorter-term business cycles, because the financial system is designed in such a way that it needs to keep growing or it will collapse. Whenever the credit system contracted even briefly during the decades leading up to crisis, policymakers would cut interest rates, provide liquidity, and encourage even more credit creation. The ratio of claims for dollars to *actual* dollars was never allowed to clear out to more reasonable levels. And then, in 2008, everything began to fall apart. There were too many bank deposits for each dollar of actual bank reserves. There was too much debt in all forms relative to how many base dollars were in the financial system. Interest rates were cut to zero and promises of liquidity were assured, but this time, that wasn't enough to deal with the sheer scale of the underlying leverage.

Policymakers then had a big choice to make. Bank failures would lead to more bank failures, which would then lead to even more bank failures. Should they let the system collapse? If so, many depositors would be wiped out like the 1930s, and even FDIC insurance wouldn't be enough since they had an amount of cash equal to less than 1% of total deposits to insure deposits with. If there is 63 times as much total debt in the system (IOUs for dollars) as there is base money (actual dollars), then perhaps most of that debt is unrealistic and needs to all get wiped away? Or should policymakers step in and prevent that collapse from happening? If there is too much debt relative to base money, then perhaps rather than letting all that debt default, policymakers can just\... rapidly increase the amount of base money out of thin air, to prevent large portions of broad money from defaulting and going away?

In other words, when the music on this highly leveraged system stopped, either IOUs (bonds and bank deposits) were going to collapse downward toward the size of the monetary base through massive defaults, or the monetary base would need to be expanded upwards to "make good" the large number of dollar IOUs that had been created during prior years and decades.

Of course, policymakers chose the latter option. Figure 19-F shows the total debt in the country (all the IOUs for dollars) and the monetary base of the country (the number of actual base dollars in the system) separately. In 2008, as the music stopped and total debt began to fall due to an uptick in defaults, rather than letting the system collapse in on itself, the Federal Reserve rapidly expanded the monetary base.

![](media/image40.png){width="4.5in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 19-F[^291]

Debt never deleveraged in absolute terms after 2008, but private debt did deleverage mildly relative to the size of the broad money supply, mildly relative to GDP, and significantly relative to the base money supply. Private debt began growing more slowly, and base money expanded rapidly. Broad money would normally *decrease* during such a large financial crisis due to multiple bank failures and deposit losses that exceed FDIC insurance capabilities, but due to policy intervention, broad money kept growing at a moderate pace anyway. Defaulted debts and defaulted bank deposits destroy broad money, and those things were mostly prevented. Banks were given more liquidity (newly printed cash reserves) in exchange for some of their less liquid assets, which made them less reliant on other banks to meet their liquidity needs.

This is what makes a long-term debt cycle different than merely a normal business cycle. Debt is allowed and incentivized to accumulate to such massive heights through decades of recurring policy intervention to prevent credit-clearing events from ever happening, and once interest rates can't go much lower and debt is at incredibly high levels, it all risks unraveling. Rather than letting that unraveling happen, policymakers begin rapidly expanding the monetary base and shifting toward a policy of currency debasement to maintain constant broad money growth even as private debt growth slows down. With too much debt in the system relative to base money, the base money supply is increased rather than debt being allowed to nominally default on a massive scale. This is what makes the resolution of a long-term debt cycle different than a short-term debt cycle. The events of a long-term debt cycle are like the climax of a television show's entire season, while the events of a normal business cycle are like individual episodes of that season.

**A One-Two Punch**

Many people thought that the rapid increase in base money during the 2008 crisis would be hyperinflationary, and mark "the end of the dollar as we know it."[^292] But they were wrong, and in a big way.[^293]

This is because it was mostly just banks that were bailed out in 2008, rather than everyone. Base money increased a lot, but broad money just kept growing at a moderate pace. After massively increasing the monetary base, those existing broad dollars (which are ultimately just fractionally reserved commercial bank deposit IOUs for base dollars) were just more backed by base dollars, and thus the broad dollars didn't vanish with bank failures as they otherwise would have. After all of this intervention, the average person didn't have much additional money in their bank account compared to what they had before the intervention. Since they didn't have much extra money, where would this hyperinflation come from? The answer is that it wouldn't come, or at least not anytime soon. Figure 19-G zooms in a bit and shows both broad money and base money from 1995 through 2022.

![](media/image41.png){width="4.5in" height="3.15in"}

Figure 19-G[^294]

If broad money increases dramatically (as it did during 2020-2021 but not 2008-2009), that does tend to be inflationary for consumer prices. In that scenario, people have a lot more money to spend, and approximately the same amount of goods and services available to spend it on, and so prices will adjust upwards because, really, the currency is adjusting downwards. However, if only base money increases rapidly and broad money stays relatively normal (as was the case after 2008), then while this change will have various effects, the average person does not have more dollars to spend on goods and services. For this reason, I tend to describe the events of 2008 as "anti-deflationary" rather than outright inflationary; the rapid expansion of the monetary base, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and other actions prevented people from *losing* broad dollar IOUs by preventing uninsured bank failures but didn't give people *more* broad dollar IOUs to spend.

Long-term debt cycles, at least in the modern era, tend to occur with a one-two punch, and to see it we need to separate government debt from non-government debt. The first punch is a big private debt bubble that pops, which is disinflationary. This happened in the 1930s and the 2010s. The second punch is a big public debt bubble that grows in its place, which is inflationary, and is used to offset the damage from the popping of that prior private debt bubble. This happened in the 1940s and the 2020s. In other words, as the long-term debt cycle unfolds, the excess debt starts to shift from the private sector to the government, and the true climax of the event does not occur until the government itself runs into an acute inflationary debt spiral.

Figure 19-H shows U.S. fiscal and monetary policy from 1920 through 2022 and helps shed light on the prospects for future inflation or lack thereof.

![](media/image42.png){width="5.010416666666667in" height="6.989583333333333in"}

Figure 19-H[^295]

With Figure 19-H in mind along with the rest of the historical knowledge that we have, the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s have thus far been an echo of what happened in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s.

- 1920s and 2000s = booming private credit growth.

- 1929 and 2008 = generational financial crises.

- 1930s and 2010s = economic stagnation and rising populism.

- 1940s and 2020s = geopolitical conflict and populist, deficit-driven inflation.

This is not because cycles magically happen; it's because each part of the process directly feeds into the next part of the process, and it's all enforced by the set of incentives that exist for participants and policymakers involved with the system.

The 1920s and 2000s both had booming private credit growth, with much of that credit being used for speculation. In the 1920s, stocks were speculated on with massive leverage, thanks in part due to so much money having been created relative to the amount of gold in the system during World War I. In the 2000s, real estate was speculated on with massive leverage, thanks in part due to interest rates being cut to 1% after the bursting of the dot-com bubble. These speculative credit booms popped in 1929 and 2008 respectively and resulted in generational financial crises that threatened to collapse the entire banking system.

In the aftermath of the financial crises of both 1929 and 2008, the monetary base was greatly expanded to recapitalize and reliquefy the banking system and prevent further systemic bank failures and loss of customer deposits, with the difference being that it was done more quickly in the aftermath of 2008 (before people lost bank deposits) than in the aftermath of 1929 (after a third of bank deposits were already wiped out from bank failures). In the 1930s, the expansion of the monetary base was done by sharply devaluing the dollar relative to gold, so that the dollar-denominated monetary base could expand even as the amount of gold in the system remained relatively fixed. In 2008 and into the 2010s, the expansion of the monetary base was done by the Federal Reserve creating a lot of new bank reserves out of thin air and using them to buy Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities from banks, which gave banks more cash liquidity and thus made them less reliant on each other for servicing their liquidity needs. The previous Figure 19-H showed the monetary base as a percentage of GDP and how these periods were similar in that regard.

Both the 1930s and the 2010s experienced weak economic growth. Between the two, the 1930s were far worse due to the Dust Bowl and other matters, but the 2010s were still incredibly painful for a lot of people. Deaths by alcohol and drug overdose, for example, dramatically increased in the 2010s, especially for men.[^296] In both the 1930s and 2010s, political populism began to rise, with more and more people feeling that the system was structured against them. In the 1930s, there was a rise in communist sympathies and union organization, and a strong shift in favor of President Roosevelt's New Deal policies. In the 2010s, the Tea Party on the political right fought against ever-rising government debt and bank bailouts, while Occupy Wall Street on the political left fought against corporate cronyism and bank bailouts. I contend that these Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements were two sides of the same coin --- a pushback against the country's flexible ledger and the associated practice of using public debt and money-printing to save the large and well-connected entities at the expense of the everyday person.

The 1930s period of rising populism and economic stagnation was global, and eventually contributed to World War II in the 1940s. When the economic pie is not growing, and people are frustrated, they often turn to strongmen leaders to tell them (incorrectly) who to blame. This growing extremism resulted in massive military spending as multiple countries engaged in global warfare. In the United States, deficits equal to a huge percentage of global economic output were printed and spent on manufacturing facilities, commodities, workers, and soldiers. When soldiers came home from war, they were given financial aid to become educated, and given subsidized loans for a house.[^297] Altogether, this was an enormous fiscal stimulus with printed money and represented a financial shift from creditors to debtors. Meanwhile, annual price inflation reached a peak of 19% in the 1940s and averaged about 6% between the early 1940s and the early 1950s, and yet the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low and expanded the monetary base dramatically to keep buying federal debt at low interest rates to fund the war.[^298] Anyone holding cash or bonds was sharply devalued throughout the decade.

From 1930 to 1935 U.S. federal debt increased from \$16.2 billion to \$28.7 billion, which was a 77% increase in five years, as the government dealt with the Great Depression. And then from 1935 to 1940 U.S. federal debt increased from \$28.7 billion to \$43.0 billion, which was a 50% increase in five years. People thought those periods of federal debt accumulation were big at the time, but then from 1940 to 1945 U.S. federal debt increased from \$43.0 billion to \$259 billion, which was a 500% increase in five years.[^299] That 1940s period was totally different and was inflationary because of it. Existing debts were rapidly devalued due to high levels of deficit-driven inflation.

The 2010s period of rising populism and economic stagnation was also global (aside from Asia) as North America, Latin America, Africa, and Europe all experienced weak or even in some cases negative economic growth. Foreign countries began to gradually buy fewer U.S. Treasuries with their foreign exchange reserves, and to buy more gold instead, while also expanding various alliances and seeking alternative payment rails outside of the dollar-based financial order. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic struck our very leveraged global financial system, and high amounts of leverage creates fragility. Highly leveraged households and businesses couldn't withstand a multi-month shock to their cash flows. Highly leveraged sovereign bond markets couldn't withstand a sudden drop-off in taxable income. The public in most developed countries would not stand for bailouts of the companies without bailouts for themselves. In the United States, COVID-19 was responded to with fiscal deficits relative to the size of the economy that had not been seen since the 1940s. Trillions of dollars were spent on household stimulus checks, childcare tax credits, small business loans that turned into grants, and corporate bailouts. The Federal Reserve greatly increased the monetary base and bought large portions of the massive U.S. federal debt issuance to fund these payouts, which is a method of monetizing the debt and basically outright money-printing. The broad money supply grew by 40% in just two years, which was very different than what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. And then in 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, and a proxy war between NATO countries and Russia ensued, which resulted in further supply disruptions, partial de-globalization, and an uptick in military spending.

**A Fiscal Spiral**

When rapid broad money supply growth and consumer price inflation occur due to unusually rapid bank lending (as was the case in the 1970s due to a demographics bulge), a common central bank policy tool is to aggressively raise interest rates to try to slow down that lending activity and thereby slow down money supply growth.

However, when broad money supply growth and consumer price inflation are occurring due to unusually large fiscal deficits that are being monetized by the central bank or commercial banking system (as was the case in the 1940s and again in the early 2020s), that tool of aggressively raising interest rates is less effective and even counterproductive. This is because higher interest rates on already-high sovereign debt result in even larger deficits due to higher interest expenses, and therefore can result in even more money creation and inflation pouring into the economy. There's no end in sight for how to resolve the problem of high government debts if interest rates on that debt are high.[^300]

So, at the end of a long-term debt cycle, how are large sovereign debts dealt with? The answer is that they are partially defaulted on in some way, either nominally or informally through inflation. When this happened in the 20th century what occurred was financial repression, meaning the debts were partially inflated away and capital controls were used to block some of the exits.

During the 1940s, rather than raise interest rates, the Federal Reserve was effectively captured by the U.S. Treasury Department and kept interest rates low despite high inflation.[^301] Figure 19-I shows the annual inflation rate alongside 3-month Treasury bill rates during that era.

Figure 19-I[^302]

A key result of this wide gap between interest rates and inflation was that the purchasing power of bondholders and cash savers was sharply devalued. These holders of credit relied on a social contract to maintain a relatively stable unit of account, and that social contract rapidly shifted. Creditors received the dollars they were owed, but by that time each dollar had lost considerable purchasing power from when the loans were made, due to massive supply dilution. It was basically a debt default and restructuring but occurred by redefining the dollar itself rather than by nominally defaulting on the debt contracts.

A problem, however, is that when interest rates are way below the prevailing inflation rate and fiscal deficits are very large, it encourages speculative borrowing. If you can borrow money at 5% per year due to suppression of interest rates when inflation is 10% per year, and use that loan to buy hard assets, why wouldn't you? The smart thing to do in that environment is to short the currency by taking out a loan or issuing a bond with a low interest rate and a long duration and buy something scarce with it. Central bankers then face a dilemma when the government has large debts and deficits: High interest rates would result in an unrecoverable fiscal spiral by the government toward ever-higher deficit-driven inflation, but low interest rates would encourage excessive borrowing and money creation via the private sector creating loans to buy hard assets.

Therefore, in periods of high public debt and negative inflation-adjusted interest rates, that type of private sector borrowing tends to be discouraged. During periods of financial repression, governments historically turn to capital controls and lending restrictions to ensure that people hold the currency and the bonds while they are devalued. Interest rates are kept low for the government, but restrictions are placed on the private sector from making use of those low interest rates in unapproved ways.

A paper in the journal *Economic Policy* by Carmen Reinhart and Belen Sbrancia from 2015 called "The Liquidation of Government Debt" studied the period from 1945 to 1980 across multiple countries quite thoroughly, as their government debts were reduced relative to the size of their economies. Their abstract reads:

> High public debt often produces the drama of default and restructuring. But debt is also reduced through financial repression, a tax on bondholders and savers via negative or below-market real interest rates. After WWII, capital controls and regulatory restrictions created a captive audience for government debt, limiting tax-base erosion. Financial repression is most successful in liquidating debt when accompanied by inflation. For the advanced economies, real interest rates were negative half of the time during 1945--1980. Average annual interest expense savings for a 12---country sample range from about 1 to 5 percent of GDP for the full 1945--1980 period. We suggest that, once again, financial repression may be part of the toolkit deployed to cope with the most recent surge in public debt in advanced economies.[^303]

In the United States, people were banned from owning gold between the 1930s and the 1970s and could be sentenced to 10 years in prison if they didn't comply. This was an example of what is meant by a "captive audience." As the public ledger was being rapidly debased, most attempts to flee to another sort of ledger, even just the natural ledger of a benign yellow metal, were stopped and squashed in various direct or indirect ways.

Overall, the 1940s marked the climactic end of decades of geopolitical conflict and a long-term debt cycle. Throughout the 1930s and the 1940s, debt was effectively transferred from the private sector to the public sector, and then inflated away. It was a partial debt jubilee, similar to debt jubilees of antiquity. The centralized monetary unit was rapidly debased, and any attempts to flee from holding it while it was debased were heavily restricted.

The United States and most other developed countries have built up a similar problem in recent decades. Private sector credit growth has been consistently encouraged by policymakers, and whenever it blows up some of it gets transferred to being public sector debt via fiscal bailouts. Additionally, multiple wars were financed purely with public debt. Now, with public sector debt this high, it's at the stage where it is likely to get inflated away over time. There is little else for lawmakers and policymakers to do about it. Figure 19-J is from the Congressional Budget Office and shows their projection of future U.S. federal government debts as a percentage of GDP.

Figure 19-J[^304]

However, here in the 2020s with government debt levels across the developed world having reached levels similar to what they were in the 1940s, it may be harder for the government to repeat the same financial repression process this time. Back in the 1940s, the fiscal deficits and inflation that devalued the debt were triggered by war and could be turned off after the war was over. Developed countries still had young populations and low dependency ratios between elders and workers back then. In the United States in 1950 for example, there were 16 workers to support every retiree receiving Social Security benefits. In the 2020s, that number is now under three workers per retired beneficiary, and in the decades ahead it is projected to fall to as low as two.[^305] Medicare has a similar top-heavy problem. We as a country have made promises on our centralized flexible ledger that are challenging to back up by real-world resources, and the same is true for most developed countries in the world. Unlike the 1940s, there is no end in sight for the fiscal deficits that need to be run, and which need to be financed at negative inflation-adjusted interest rates. Plus, we exist in a world of social media where people can rapidly share information about what's happening.

Unlike the 1940s, there is no big common cause that we're all willing to sacrifice purchasing power for; instead, our predicament was just caused by a gradual mismanagement of the public ledger over time, with everyone pointing the blame at others. Voters wanted all sorts of things without knowing how to pay for them: They voted politicians into office that promised them tax cuts without spending cuts, or who promised spending increases without tax increases. Politicians were incentivized to promise these things because they would likely lose elections if they did not. And whenever a crisis occurred, it was always put on the public ledger with debt and printed money so that the cost of paying for it could be figured out by the next generation.

It will be very challenging for political parties throughout the developed world (and particularly the United States and Europe) to agree on how to handle this public debt problem in the 2020s and 2030s. Decades of having a flexible ledger combined with short-term incentives to use it have resulted in a very imbalanced situation that is likely to be rather inflationary for the broad money supply to varying degrees for the foreseeable future. Debt must be restructured or inflated away, but who will be left holding the bag?

Could this have turned out differently? Around the margins it could have, but for the destination I don't think it could have. In addition to the historical human tendency to think linearly even as debt compounds exponentially, this time the generational debt accumulation was empowered by the fact that the invention of telecommunication systems allowed commerce to occur at the speed of light while any sort of hard money could still only settle at the speed of matter. Gold, despite being of sounder supply than the fiat dollar, takes considerable time and expense to transport and authenticate, and thus could never really present an alternative in a digital era. Once the fiat dollar came into being, those who manage it were able to discard gold as a supply constraint without much pushback and use the flexibility of their ledger to opaquely finance war, entitlements, and all sorts of things in ways that don't add up in the long run. It was the first time where a weaker money globally won out over a harder money, and it occurred because a new variable was added to the monetary competition: *speed*. This speed gap between commerce and settlements empowered banks and central banks, and created an irresistible arbitrage that the whole world turned to, which led to a greater level of centralization for the public ledger than ever before.

Entropy is the law by which physical systems inevitably become more disordered over time, because the disorder imposed by friction and heat loss only moves in one direction. A similar sort of financial entropy has built up in our system, as fiat credit can only move in one direction (higher) without the whole highly leveraged system collapsing. Meanwhile, the system with its built-in flexibility at the base monetary layer tends to incentivize politicians and their voters to keep making promises that, once the numbers really begin to hit hard, aren't maintainable as originally intended; the difference is just printed. The present has been persistently improved at the cost of the future. Dealing with the public debt has always been the next politician's problem, and yet now, toward the later stages of a long-term debt cycle, we're beginning to reach the point where the problems are materializing in the present.
