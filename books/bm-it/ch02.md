**What is Money?**

"*The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot --- including problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression. These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics --- they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects.*"[^7]
