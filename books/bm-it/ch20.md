# Chapter 15: **How Fiat Currency is Created and Destroyed**

While fiat currency has no significant cost to produce, there are specific rules and mechanisms that dictate how fiat currency is created and destroyed. For the most part, it is created whenever new debt is created, and is destroyed whenever debts are defaulted on or paid back. And to complicate matters, since the modern financial system uses fractional reserve banking, there are multiple definitions of money, with "base money" and "broad money" being the two most relevant definitions to understand.

The supplies of these two types of money have grown significantly over time. In 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created, there was \$2.79 billion in base money and \$19.31 billion in broad money.[^207] At the end of 2022, there was \$5.4 trillion (\$5,400 billion) in base money and \$21.4 trillion (\$21,400 billion) in broad money.[^208] This chapter walks through these two different types of money, and how each type of money is specifically created or destroyed. The focus is on the United States, but the same idea applies nearly everywhere else.

**Base Money**

The monetary base or "base money" is the foundation of the fiat currency system and consists of the combination of 1) physical currency in circulation, and 2) cash reserves that the commercial banking system holds with the Federal Reserve.

This monetary base is a direct liability of the Federal Reserve. When the system was originally created, this monetary base was redeemable for gold and backed up by a sizable fraction of gold, but since 1971 it hasn't been redeemable for or backed by anything. There is, however, a considerable amount of demand for U.S. dollars hardcoded into the financial system: It's the only currency that U.S. taxes can be paid with and it's the unit of account that everyone must use if they want to interact with the U.S. banking system. Additionally, the dollar has been relied upon for a high percentage of international cross-border trade for a long time, due to a strong network effect and lack of better options. In other words, for most of the past century, the U.S. Federal Reserve has operated the largest and most widely used ledger in the world.

Figure 15-A shows the amount of currency in circulation and the amount of reserves in the system. The combination of these two numbers represents the total monetary base since 1960.

Figure 15-A[^209]

As the chart shows, physical currency in circulation goes up in a rather smooth, exponential way. The amount of bank reserves used to go up at a similarly smooth rate until 2008 when it began to go up at a quicker pace due to the need for bank recapitalizations. A similar process of rapid recapitalization happened back in the 1930s as well. Some of these details will be discussed later in this chapter.

Bank reserves at the Federal Reserve are fungible (interchangeable) with each other. As people like you and I use various payment systems to transact with each other, our banks use reserves to settle with each other behind the scenes. Using Fedwire for example, banks that want to settle with each other can just tell the Federal Reserve to re-arrange the number of reserves they have listed for each bank on their ledger.

In principle, physical currency and bank reserves are also fungible with each other, and represent equivalent claims to the monetary base, subject to certain practical limitations. In theory, if we all wanted to go and take out some of our bank cash at once, it would come out of bank reserves. In practice, however, the amount of physical currency is limited at any given time and banks hold very little of it, so if there was a bank run for cash, depositors would quickly find themselves limited in how much cash they would physically be allowed (or able) to withdraw.

The U.S. Treasury Department creates coins and banknotes (via the Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, respectively), but the Federal Reserve is responsible for putting them into circulation. Each year, the Federal Reserve orders physical money from the U.S. Treasury based on how much it thinks the public will want in physical form, both to replace existing damaged money and to account for some fraction of dollars wanting to be withdrawn from banks in physical form.

In other words, the Federal Reserve determines the size of the monetary base, and what percentage of it exists in physical form for consumers.[^210] As is described later in this chapter, the Federal Reserve has certain methods to create or destroy new bank reserves and thus increase or decrease the size of the monetary base.

**Broad money**

The broad money supply is far larger than the base money supply and represents money that the public holds. This broad money calculation consists of currency in circulation (which is also part of the base money calculation), but then also includes the massive amounts of checking deposits, savings deposits, and certificates of deposit that people and businesses hold at commercial banks (collectively referred to as "bank deposits").

As shown by Figure 15-B, what makes bank deposits different than physical currency and bank reserves, is that rather than being a direct liability of the Federal Reserve, they are instead a liability of a specific commercial bank.

Figure 15-B

Figure 15-C shows the amount of broad money in the U.S. financial system since 1960.

![](media/image25.png){width="4.5in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 15-C[^211]

Broad money represents the big set of money that people and businesses directly use to transact with each other, store our savings in, and define as our "money." We often think that a dollar is interchangeable with another dollar, but really when we go from interacting with physical dollars to bank account IOUs, we switch from owning a direct liability of the Federal Reserve to a fractional claim for a direct liability of the Federal Reserve.[^212]

If a particular commercial bank goes bankrupt, then consumer and business deposits at that bank may be defaulted on; thus, broad money can be destroyed by a bank failure. This happened on a massive scale in the 1930s during the Great Depression, and so the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was set up in 1933 to try to prevent that from happening on a widespread scale again. The FDIC is a government agency insurance system that banks pay into which insures customer deposits up to \$250,000 per account if a bank fails.

However, the FDIC is primarily meant to improve consumer confidence regarding the risk of individual bank failures and thus prevent bank runs, rather than to actually backstop a widespread multibank failure. The FDIC only has enough funds to cover a very small percentage of bank failures if a widespread financial crisis were to occur. In practice, such an emergency would likely result in a massive combined fiscal and monetary response by the Treasury and Federal Reserve to print new money and bail out the system to prevent a deflationary collapse and riots --- with the bailouts during the 2008 and 2023 financial crises being recent examples. However, that's above the authority of the FDIC itself, and so without an act of Congress, most bank deposits are indeed at risk if there is a widespread failure of the highly leveraged commercial banking system.

For both base money and broad money, most countries currently work the same way as the United States. A country's central bank manages the base money of the system, and the commercial banking system operates the larger amount of broad money that represents an indirect and fractionally reserved claim to this base money.

**The Relationship Between Broad and Base Money**

While the Federal Reserve determines the size of the U.S. monetary base, including what percentage of it may exist in the physical form of banknotes, changes in the amount of broad money in the system depend on forces outside of their direct control, such as government deficits and commercial bank lending practices. In other words, the Federal Reserve does not directly control the size of the broad money supply or the ratio of broad money to base money, even though they do control the amount of base money in the system. They can, however, influence the size of the broad money supply through their various monetary policy tools.

The purpose of modern commercial banks is to "multiply" base money into broad money and make a profit while doing so. We can call this the "money multiplier," which is defined as the broad money supply divided by the base money supply. Figure 15-D shows the money multiplier since 1870.

![](media/image26.png){width="4.5in" height="3.1430555555555557in"}

Figure 15-D[^213]

When a bank makes a loan to someone to buy an asset with (such as a house), it becomes a new deposit in the bank account of the seller of that asset, and the lending bank sends the reserve amount to the seller's bank; the process increases the total amount of commercial bank deposits and broad money in the system. So, when they "loan reserves," banks collectively don't actually reduce total bank reserves in the banking system; they just lever those reserves up with a higher money multiplier and change the location and/or ownership of those reserves. To put it simply, lending creates deposits.[^214]

Any individual bank can leverage itself by lending money or buying securities, and thus reducing its cash reserves at the Federal Reserve. However, when they make those loans or buy those securities, they create deposits somewhere else in the financial system, and those deposits result in reserves shifting from the lending bank to the bank that is receiving those deposits. Similarly, a bank could sell assets and increase its cash reserves, but in doing so, some other bank deposits elsewhere in the system would be drained to buy those assets, and reserves would shift toward the seller.

Therefore, the banking system can't decide to collectively increase or decrease the system-wide amount of bank reserves, even though any individual bank can alter its own level of reserves. Banks can collectively increase the money multiplier (the broad money supply divided by base money) by making more loans, but they can't change the total system-wide amount of bank reserves. They can just move bank reserves around, leverage them up, or deleverage them, by changing how many deposit IOUs they create on those reserves.

Similarly, the U.S. Treasury Department can determine the size of its cash account at the Federal Reserve, which for most purposes can be considered as a special subset of bank reserves. To increase the size of their cash account at the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury can issue Treasury bonds, bring in a lot of cash, and then hold the cash in that account at the Federal Reserve for a while before spending it. This sucks other bank reserves out of the system, on a 1:1 basis with the Treasury cash account increase. When they eventually reduce the Treasury cash account by spending more than they take in, that money goes into peoples' and companies' bank accounts, and thus winds up back in other bank reserves through the settlement process.

The public can theoretically pull money out of excess bank reserves into physical currency, or deposit physical currency into banks which can become bank reserves. In practice, however, physical currency is limited on purpose, so if the public collectively tries to pull bank reserves out into physical currency, they get told by the bank teller that they can't --- due to a nationwide shortage of physical currency or maximum (daily) withdrawal limits. The Federal Reserve each year decides how much more currency to put into circulation, and thus it has firm control on the ratio between currency in circulation and bank reserves, as the two parts of the total monetary base.

During very healthy banking environments with high monetary velocity and a lot of trust between banks, the banking system can function smoothly with a high money multiplier and relatively little reserves in the system. It's not inherently stable, but the unstable parts of the system are not coming to the forefront. This is because whenever a bank needs liquidity to meet customer deposit withdrawals, it can sell assets or borrow from other banks. It's like a game of musical chairs with the music playing loudly, and so it keeps working. However, when the system becomes overleveraged and/or when banks don't trust each other much anymore due to the possibility of insolvency, banks are more reluctant to lend to each other, and the music starts to slow or stop entirely. At that point, the high ratio of broad money to base money becomes a problem, and deposits risk being defaulted on unless the central bank creates more base money.

The Federal Reserve can create new base money by performing quantitative easing, or "QE" for short. To do this, the Federal Reserve creates new bank reserves out of thin air and buys existing assets, like Treasuries or mortgage-backed securities with those new reserves. It's an asset swap, but one side was created out of thin air during the swap. After creating the reserves and performing this asset swap with them, the new reserves become owned by a commercial bank (and thus become the Federal Reserve's liabilities), and the securities become owned by the Federal Reserve (and thus become the Federal Reserve's assets). In this process, the Federal Reserve increases their total assets (the securities they are buying) and increases their total liabilities (the new reserves they are creating) by the same amount. Their primary liabilities represent the monetary base of the country, which are now larger after this process is performed.

The Federal Reserve can also decrease the amount of existing base money by performing quantitative tightening, or "QT" for short. To do this, they sell Treasuries or mortgage-backed securities for reserves and therefore delete those reserves. More specifically, instead of directly selling them, they usually let some Treasuries or mortgage-back securities mature, which means their asset expires and pays back its principle, which turns into reserves, and then they delete those reserves rather than using them to reinvest back into similar assets. In this process of selling securities or letting securities mature without reinvestment, both the Federal Reserve's assets and liabilities decrease.

In a vacuum, neither QE nor QT alone necessarily affect the broad money supply significantly; they primarily affect the monetary base. However, if the U.S. federal government is running very large fiscal deficits and the Federal Reserve is creating new bank reserves to buy the Treasury bond issuance on the secondary market to fund those deficits, it directly creates new broad money (and thus goes around the bank lending channel) in addition to creating new base money.

On the other hand, if the U.S. federal government were to run big fiscal surpluses on a sustained basis (i.e., tax more than they spend), at a time when banks aren't lending much either, they can theoretically decrease the total amount of broad money. Historically this occurs only very rarely and briefly. Additionally, widespread bank collapses without any bailout or FDIC insurance can also theoretically reduce broad money, which happened in the early 1930s but has otherwise been avoided.

**Bank Reserve Accounting Examples**

The rest of this chapter goes deeper into the details of base and broad money creation. I'll work through six examples of bank lending, QE, and fiscal deficits, to help show which types of actions by banks, the Federal Reserve, and the U.S. federal government can influence the amount and location of bank reserves and broad money supply in the financial system. (Feel free to skip to the end-of-chapter summary if these details are unimportant to you; this level of detail doesn't have to be understood for the rest of the book to make sense.)

I originally created these examples in November 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of an article called "Banks, QE, and Money-Printing"[^215] to show why the fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus at the time would likely be inflationary for consumer prices, and how it differed from the type of quantitative easing that occurred after the 2008 crisis. Many analysts at the time were brushing off the possibility for serious price inflation because they underestimated the importance of fiscal spending as a transmission mechanism, underestimated the difference in importance between broad money and base money, and therefore thought that this round of quantitative easing would be similar to what happened in 2008.[^216] By the second half of 2021, we indeed experienced rather high levels of consumer price inflation, which eventually reached multi-decade high levels of consumer price inflation in 2022.[^217]

For each example, I have two people, Mary and Sara, the two banks that they do business with, the Federal Reserve, and the U.S. Treasury Department. Each of these six entities has a column that represent each of their assets and liabilities "A \| L."

Each example is a small, closed-loop financial system. Each block in an entity's asset or liability column represents \$1,000 in value.

- "D" represents a \$1,000 customer bank deposit.

- "R" represents a \$1,000 cash reserve allocation that a bank has at the Federal Reserve.

- "T" represents a \$1,000 U.S. Treasury bond: U.S. federal government debt.

- Other assets --- like a \$1,000 used car, "C," or a \$1,000 car loan, "L," --- are sometimes used as well.

A deposit block "D" is an asset for a consumer, and is simultaneously a liability for their commercial bank, since the bank holds it on behalf of the consumer and owes it to them on demand.

Similarly, a reserve block "R" is an asset for a commercial bank, and they keep it at the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve lists it as a liability, owed to the bank who deposited it with them.

Likewise, a Treasury bond "T" is an asset for whoever holds it, whether a consumer, or a commercial bank, or the Federal Reserve, and is a liability of the U.S. Treasury.

A bank loan block "L" or mortgage block "M" is an asset for the bank that lent it and is a liability for the consumer who borrowed it from their bank.

**Example 1: A Bank Loans Money**

This is the simplest example to show how banks create deposits and broad money without reducing the number of reserves in the system. It involves Mary buying a used car from Sara with a loan that Mary takes out from her bank.

Figure 15-E shows this exchange, with a beginning, intermediate, and ending state, and a description afterward, so you can go back and forth between the visual and the description. The underlined letters represent ones that recently changed:

![](media/image27.png){width="3.5in" height="6.638888888888889in"}

Figure 15-E

*Beginning State*

Mary begins with "D" in assets, meaning a \$1,000 deposit in her bank, and no liabilities. Her bank (which is very unlevered) starts with her deposit "D" as a \$1,000 liability, and then has two reserve block assets "R," collectively representing \$2,000 held at the Fed.

Sara begins with "DDDC" in assets, meaning \$3,000 in bank deposits at her bank "DDD," and a \$1,000 used car "C," and no liabilities. Her bank starts with her deposit "DDD" as liabilities, and has its assets primarily invested in Treasuries "TTT" and one reserve block at the Federal Reserve "R."

The Federal Reserve holds the three blocks of reserves from the two banks as its liabilities and has three blocks of Treasuries as its assets. The banks use the Federal Reserve as their bank, in a similar way that Mary and Sara use their banks. In other words, the two banks store their cash reserve assets in their accounts at the Federal Reserve, which are the Federal Reserve's liabilities.

The U.S. Treasury Department, representing the financial arm of the overall U.S. federal government, has six blocks of Treasuries outstanding as its liabilities. For the sake of simplicity, it doesn't have any assets listed, but in reality, its assets would consist of working capital, various federal buildings and lands and military assets, and primarily its ability to tax citizens. In this example, its six Treasury liabilities are owned by the Federal Reserve and Sara's bank.

Between Mary and Sara's cash, there are four deposit "D" blocks in the total system, which are assets for them and liabilities for their banks. Likewise, there are three reserve "R" blocks in the system, which are assets for their banks and liabilities for the Federal Reserve.

*Intermediate State*

Now, for the intermediate state, Mary and Sara enter negotiations, and Sara agrees to sell her car to Mary for \$1,000. Mary, however, only has \$1,000 in deposits, and although she needs the car, she doesn't want to be completely cashless. So, she goes to her bank and takes out a \$1,000 car loan "L." Mary's bank creates a \$1,000 deposit "D" for Mary and creates a \$1,000 loan liability "L" for her as well. For the bank itself, Mary's new deposit asset is its new liability, and Mary's new loan liability is its new asset. No reserves moved, but a new deposit was created.

Mary's net worth is unchanged at \$1,000 in total, but she now has \$2,000 in deposits and \$1,000 in loan liabilities, and thus is a bit more leveraged. Mary's bank's equity is unchanged as well, but it also leveraged itself up a bit, by creating a new asset and a new liability, since it expects that Mary will be able to pay the loan back with interest.

Neither the Federal Reserve nor the U.S. Treasury are involved yet.

There are now five deposit "D" blocks in the system rather than four, because Mary's bank is more levered with an additional asset and liability. It created new broad money by lending a new deposit into existence. However, there are still three reserve "R" blocks in the system.

*Ending State*

For the ending state, Mary wires Sara \$1,000 for the car, and therefore gives her the new deposit "D" that she just received from her bank loan. Sara receives the wire in her bank account, and her bank credits this by giving her an extra \$1,000 deposit asset "D," which becomes a new liability for her bank. Behind the scenes, Mary's bank sends a \$1,000 reserve block "R" to Sara's bank to honor the wire (by instructing the Federal Reserve, as the central ledger, to move the R from Mary's bank reserve account to Sara's bank reserve account). So, Sara's bank now has a new liability "D" in the form of Sara's new deposit, but also has a new reserve block "R" as its new asset. Sara's bank doesn't have any creditworthy clients asking for loans currently, so it keeps its new reserve block at its Federal Reserve account for now.

The Federal Reserve's ending state is unchanged on net, except that it updated its bookkeeping for its two client banks when Mary's bank sent Sara's bank a \$1,000 reserve block "R." The Federal Reserve used to attribute "RR" to Mary's bank and "R" to Sara's bank on its ledger, but now it attributes "R" to Mary's bank and "RR" to Sara's bank. These reserve blocks are liabilities for the Federal Reserve and assets for its client banks.

The U.S. Treasury's ending state is also unchanged, and unlike the Federal Reserve, it wasn't even aware of the transaction at all.

In the final ending state, just like the intermediate state, there are still three reserve blocks "R" in the system, and there are five deposit blocks "D," which is one extra deposit block compared to the beginning state, created by Mary's bank loan.

The point of this example is to show how, when a bank uses its reserves to lend money, the reserves aren't destroyed. The money shows up in another bank, and the reserve amount is sent there. The overall number of reserves or base money in the system is unchanged, but the system becomes slightly more levered, and has more consumer deposits and therefore more broad money. In other words, the money multiplier ratio (D-to-R, broad money to base money) increased from 4-to-3 to 5-to-3.

Any bank can increase or decrease its own number of reserves by buying or selling assets or making loans. However, those reserves get moved around to or from other banks rather than created or destroyed. Banks can, however, create or reduce the number of deposits leveraged on those reserves, depending on how much risk it wants to take and how many creditworthy opportunities it sees to lend money for.

**Example 2: The Federal Reserve Performs QE from Banks**

This next example is a bit more realistic, with a more levered banking system. It involves the Federal Reserve performing quantitative easing on the banking system, meaning it creates new reserves to buy existing assets from the banks. The reason it might do this is because there are too many claims for base money relative to base money, and in general banks are stuffed full of illiquid assets like mortgage loans, and so the Federal Reserve wants to pull some of those illiquid assets onto its own balance sheet and create new liquid assets (an increase in reserves) for the banking system.

Figure 15-F shows the beginning and end state, and excludes the intermediate state:

![](media/image28.png){width="3.5in" height="4.454861111111111in"}

Figure 15-F

*Beginning State*

Sara and Mary are identical to each other in this example. For assets, they each have a house, "H," a car, "C," and \$4,000 in cash deposits, "DDDD," at their banks. For liabilities, they also have a car loan, "L," and a mortgage loan, "M," owed to their respective banks.

The banks are identical to each other in this example. They each have their \$4,000 customer deposits "DDDD" as liabilities owed to Mary and Sara respectively. For assets, they each have "RTTML," meaning one reserve block, two Treasury blocks, one mortgage loan block, and one car loan block. The banks are rather highly levered, with lots of assets and liabilities relative to their sole reserve block.

The Federal Reserve is small, with just "RR" in liabilities for their member bank reserve accounts, one for each, and "TT" in assets.

The U.S. Treasury has "TTTTTT" in liabilities, which are owned by the banks and the Federal Reserve.

There are eight deposit blocks "D" in the system, and two reserve blocks "R." So, the system money multiplier is levered 8-to-2.

*Ending State*

In this example, the Federal Reserve realizes that both Mary's bank and Sara's bank have just one reserve block each. Assuming the banks are each required by regulations to have at least one reserve block, this means they can't really lend any more, and can't create more broad money. Even without liquidity requirements, the banks might simply not feel comfortable that they'll be able to meet liquidity needs (deposit withdraws) without having some reasonable percentage of reserves to deposits. The Federal Reserve wants banks to be able to lend. So, the Federal Reserve decides to recapitalize the banking system by giving them plenty of excess reserve blocks. Unlike the fiscal authority (Congress and the President), the Federal Reserve can't, however, legally just give free money to banks; it must take something in return.

The Federal Reserve creates four new reserve blocks out of thin air and gives two to Mary's bank and two to Sara's bank. These new reserve blocks become liabilities of the Federal Reserve and become assets for the banks. In return, the Federal Reserve takes one mortgage block and one Treasury block from each bank. The Federal Reserve therefore adds "TTMM" to its assets and "RRRR" to its liabilities.

The banks are now more comfortable, with plenty of excess reserves as assets, and fewer Treasuries and mortgages. The asset side of their balance sheets is more liquid now since reserves are more liquid than Treasuries and mortgages. If they want to loan money or buy more securities, they now have plenty of excess reserves with which to do so without getting too low on liquidity. However, they haven't lent any more money yet, so the number of deposits or broad money in the system remains unchanged. Underneath the surface, the banks are just less leveraged and more liquid, with plenty of reserves relative to deposit liabilities and overall assets.

Mary and Sara didn't notice anything from beginning to end in this example. They have the same assets and liabilities that they started with. They weren't even aware that this happened.

The Federal Reserve is more leveraged now, with more assets and liabilities than it started with, but the same amount of equity.

The U.S. Treasury didn't change on net, except that it now attributes ownership of two of its Treasury bond liabilities to the Federal Reserve instead of to the private banks, since the Federal Reserve bought a Treasury "T" from each of the two banks.

There are still eight deposit blocks "D" in the system, but the number of reserve blocks "R" increased from two to six. So, the money multiplier in the system is now 8-to-6. The amount of broad money hasn't changed, but the amount of base money grew, due to the Federal Reserve's decision to buy bank assets with new reserves. The banking system has been recapitalized and has a lot more lending power now.

This is why, although many people think quantitative easing by itself is inflationary on consumer prices, it generally isn't. The money isn't getting out to consumers like Mary and Sara yet; it's just internal to the banking system. This quantitative easing process sets the long-term stage for inflation as an early foundation by increasing the monetary base and overall bank liquidity, and therefore it's being "anti-deflationary" by preventing a bank collapse and ensuring they have plenty of liquidity and lending capacity --- but it's not yet inflationary.

Inflation would likely come if Mary and Sara have a lot more deposit money chasing the same amount of goods and services. However, neither Mary nor Sara has more deposit money than they started with, so there's no reason for anything to be inflationary. The amount of consumer deposits in the system hasn't changed.

**Example 3: The Federal Reserve Performs QE from Nonbanks**

This third example starts with a simpler system again, very similar to Example 1. However, instead of having a car as an extra asset that she had in the first example, Sara has a Treasury bond.

Sara decides to sell her Treasury bond, but there aren't many buyers for it at the moment. So, the Federal Reserve steps in and performs QE to buy it from her. The result ends up slightly different compared to the Federal Reserve buying a Treasury bond from the banking system. This is depicted in Figure 15-G.

![](media/image29.png){width="3.5in" height="4.454861111111111in"}

Figure 15-G

*Beginning State*

Everything begins similarly to Example 1, except Sara has a Treasury bond instead of a car. There are four "D" deposits in the total system, and three "R" reserves to start.

Sara decides to sell her Treasury bond, but neither Mary nor either bank particularly want to buy it. If a lot of people sell Treasuries at once, it can cause a liquidity crisis, which is what happened for example in the United States in March 2020 and in the United Kingdom in September 2022.

So, the Federal Reserve decides to buy it and prevent a liquidity crisis. The Federal Reserve creates a new bank reserve "R" out of thin air: It tells the bank to buy Sara's Treasury bond "T" with a new deposit "D," and then to give the Treasury bond to the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve hands the bank the new bank reserve "R" in the process.

The Federal Reserve, therefore, bought Sara's Treasury bond with a brand-new reserve block, using the bank as the intermediary (so Sara and the Federal Reserve never talked to each other; Sara sold the Treasury bond to her bank for a deposit block "D," and her bank sold that Treasury bond to the Federal Reserve, who bought it with a new reserve block "R").

*Ending State*

After the bank completes this task, Sara has the same net worth as she started the example with but replaced her Treasury "T" with an extra deposit "D." Her bank also has the same equity as it started the example with but grew a bit bigger in terms of both assets and liabilities, with an extra reserve block asset "R" and an extra deposit block "D" as liability to Sara. Its equity is unchanged.

The Federal Reserve grew a bit bigger as well, with an additional Treasury asset "T" and an additional reserve liability "R," which it lists as an asset for Sara's bank. Its equity is unchanged.

The U.S. Treasury didn't change on net, except that it now recognizes Sara's initial Treasury "T" as owned by the Federal Reserve instead of Sara, since the Federal Reserve bought it.

Whether this is stimulatory for the economy or not depends on what Sara wants to do with her extra cash. She had "DDDT" and now she has "DDDD" as her assets. It's still worth \$4,000 but it's a bit more liquid now. If the reason for her selling the Treasury was to raise more cash to do something big, like start a business or lend money to her friend to start a business, then it might be stimulative. The Federal Reserve helped keep the Treasury market liquid, which allowed her to sell it despite a lack of real buyers. However, if she merely holds the money in an extra "D" deposit rather than the Treasury "T," then she's not using the money any differently. It then becomes a question of what her bank does.

Sara's bank now has an extra reserve asset block and an extra deposit block liability compared to the beginning state, meaning it's a bit bigger and has more lending power relative to its liquidity. It could finance a corporate loan, or a consumer loan, which could stimulate the economy. Or, if it thinks the economy is too risky, or if none of its creditworthy corporate or consumer clients are asking for a loan, it might just sit on its safe "RRTTT" assets and do nothing. In that case, this example wouldn't affect the economy much.

There are now five "D" deposits in the system compared to the beginning state that only had four. In addition, there are four "R" reserve blocks in the system compared to the beginning state that only had three.

So, there's more liquidity in the system, with an increase in both base money and broad money. However, none of that broad money moved yet, and is just sitting there with Sara and her bank. Broad money velocity is low, in other words. There is more inflationary potential in the system, due to there being more broad money and reserves, but no consumer price inflation yet. Sara isn't any richer; just slightly more liquid.

In this example, the Federal Reserve directly increased the amount of broad money in the system without banks doing any private lending, and without the federal government doing any spending, but it remains unclear if it will be impactful or not (subject to what Sara and/or her bank do with their extra liquidity). And even if it was impactful, the Federal Reserve wouldn't be able to repeat it a second time, because neither Mary nor Sara (the two private, nonbank entities) have any more Treasury bonds to sell to the Federal Reserve.

If anything, it's likely to be somewhat inflationary on asset prices, because Sara is flush with cash, and perhaps more willing to buy stocks, or buy more Treasuries, etc. She's a saver and this might not make her spend more, but it might shift how she invests with her extra liquidity.

**Example 4: Nonbank-Financed Helicopter Money**

The first three examples were separate cases, each meant to illustrate a different scenario.

These final three examples (Examples 4, 5, and 6) will build on each other to show what happens when the U.S. Treasury gets involved with deficit spending, with differences depending on who finances that spending by buying the Treasury debt.

Example 4 begins with a relatively unlevered system. However, the economy is in a recession, and Mary just lost her job and only has a little bit of money in her bank account. She is making her frustration known to her elected officials, so Congress authorizes the U.S. Treasury to send everyone \$1,000 in stimulus checks, right to their bank accounts. This is known in economics as "helicopter money," which originally referred to a thought experiment of dropping new money out of helicopters on consumers.[^218] The Treasury finances this by issuing Treasury bonds, which Sara (who has plenty of money and hasn't lost her job) buys. This is depicted in Figure 15-H.

Figure 15-H

*Beginning State*

Mary has a car "C" and a deposit "D" as assets, and a car loan "L" as a liability. Mary's bank has a reserve block "R" and Mary's car loan "L" as assets and has Mary's deposit "D" as its liability.

Sara has three blocks of deposits "DDD" as her assets, and no liabilities. Sara's bank has a blend of excess reserves and some Treasuries as assets "RRTT" and has Sara's three deposit blocks "DDD" as its liabilities.

The Federal Reserve has the banks' three total system reserve blocks as its liabilities and holds three Treasuries as its assets.

The U.S. Treasury has five Treasury bonds outstanding as liabilities, which are owned by the Federal Reserve and Sara's bank.

Total system deposits are 4D = \$4,000, and total system reserves are 3R = \$3,000.

*Intermediate State (not shown)*

Although it is the originator of currency, the U.S. federal government in most cases legally has to finance its spending by receiving taxes or issuing Treasury debt to settle its account.[^219]

So, the U.S. Treasury sends a \$1,000 deposit "D" block each to both Mary and Sara, deposited in their bank accounts. Both Mary and Sara are happy, because their net worth goes up by \$1,000 each. Their banks get money deposited into them, and haven't loaned any out yet, so they just keep this new cash at their Federal Reserve account as new reserves.

However, this is just a brief intermediate state. The Treasury now issues new Treasury bond liabilities "TT" to pay for the expenditures it just made. Sara then decides to use two of her deposit blocks "DD" to buy those two Treasury securities "TT," since they are yielding slightly higher rates than her bank deposit account yields.

If we imagine it happening simultaneously, what happened is that the U.S. Treasury extracted two deposit blocks from Sara (and therefore extracted two reserve blocks from Sara's bank, as Sara's bank settled the transfer with the U.S. Treasury), and the U.S. Treasury gave Sara two Treasury bond blocks as assets in return. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury gave both Mary and Sara one deposit block each, and therefore gave one reserve block to Mary's bank, and one reserve block to Sara's bank, to settle the transfers.

*Ending State*

By the end of the transfers, both Mary and Sara are \$1,000 richer than when they started. Mary's assets simply went from "CD" to "CDD" as she gained a deposit block. Sara's assets went from "DDD" to "DDTT" because she gained a deposit block but used two deposit blocks to buy two Treasury bonds.

Mary's bank is slightly bigger than when it began this example, because Mary received a deposit block "D" and her bank was credited with a reserve block "R" to settle it (but also owes an extra liability "D" owed to Mary), and Mary hasn't spent it yet. So, Mary's bank has the same equity (both its assets and liabilities increased by the same amount), but its overall combined assets and liabilities are bigger, and it has more lending power now because of that.

Sara's bank is slightly smaller than when it began, because although Sara and her bank received a deposit and reserve block respectively, Sara sent two deposit blocks to the Treasury to receive the Treasury bond, and therefore Sara's bank sent two reserve blocks to the Treasury, which were then given back out, one to Mary's bank and one back to Sara's bank. Sara's bank has the same equity, but is simply smaller, as both assets and liabilities decreased, and its lending power is decreased.

The Federal Reserve is unchanged, except that it updated its bookkeeping for one of the reserve blocks "R" originally attributed to Sara's bank to now being attributed to Mary's bank instead. Its overall amount of Treasury bond assets and reserve liabilities remains unchanged.

The U.S. Treasury is more leveraged, with an extra "TT" in debt liabilities outstanding, owed to Sara.

Total system deposits are 4D = \$4,000, and total system reserves are 3R = \$3,000, meaning that neither the total number of deposits nor reserves changed in the system from the beginning state to the end state. Deposits and reserves were just moved around a bit within the system.

**Example 5: Fed-Financed Helicopter Money**

Example 5 starts exactly where Example 4 left off and builds from there.

Both Mary and Sara are happy because they got some extra money in the previous example. However, Sara is just prudently saving her money due to uncertainty about the economy, and Mary still doesn't have a job, so she is also just saving her money; their favorite restaurants and vacation spots are closed due to a virus pandemic anyway.

Some politicians want to give \$1,000 to everyone every month for the next year, due to so many displaced workers like Mary having so little money and no jobs. Other politicians say, "No, that's too much federal debt, let the economy try to heal itself." The politicians argue for a couple months and then eventually compromise and decide to send everyone \$1,000 one more time, to see if that helps. So, Congress authorizes the U.S. Treasury to send out another round of \$1,000 to everyone.

This time, instead of Sara buying the new Treasury liabilities with her existing deposits, the Federal Reserve buys the new Treasury liabilities with new reserves. This is depicted in Figure 15-I.

![](media/image31.png){width="3.5in" height="4.454861111111111in"}

Figure 15-I

*Beginning State*

Sara already owns a lot of Treasury bonds and sees that the U.S. Treasury will become even more indebted after it sends out all of this money without raising taxes, so she doesn't want to buy any more Treasury bonds. So, how will the U.S. Treasury finance this second round of helicopter money?

Well, because there is a lot of new Treasury bond issuance but nobody wanting to buy it at current prices, the Treasury bond market suddenly becomes illiquid, and Treasury bond prices start to fall (meaning yields start to rise). Sara and her bank both get nervous because they own a lot of Treasury bonds.

The Treasury bond market briefly looks like it did in March 2020 --- totally illiquid, with yields extremely volatile.

However, this problem doesn't last long, because the Federal Reserve says, "It's fine, everyone! We'll buy the extra Treasury bond issuance by creating new bank reserves. Relax."

So, the Federal Reserve creates two new bank reserve blocks "RR" and gives them to the Treasury in exchange for the new Treasury debt liabilities, "TT," which become the Federal Reserve's assets. Technically, the Federal Reserve can't legally buy directly from the Treasury, so they agree to transfer the securities through one of the banks as a brief pass-through entity.

The U.S. Treasury then sends a \$1,000 deposit "D" each to Mary and Sara and settles this by sending a reserve block "R" to each of Mary's and Sara's banks.

*Ending State*

Mary and Sara are both \$1,000 richer, again. They each have a new \$1,000 deposit "D."

Mary and Sara's banks are both bigger, although their equity didn't change. They each have an extra \$1,000 reserve block "R," but also each have a new \$1,000 liability block to their customer deposits "D."

The Federal Reserve is bigger and more levered, with \$2,000 more assets in the form of Treasuries "TT," and \$2,000 more liabilities in the form of reserves "RR" that they hold for the banks. Their equity is unchanged.

The U.S. Treasury is bigger and more levered, with \$2,000 "TT" in more debt liabilities outstanding.

System-wide deposits (broad money) increased compared to the beginning state, from 4D = \$4,000 to 6D = \$6,000. System-wide reserves (base money) also increased compared to the beginning state, from 3R = \$3,000 to 5R = \$5,000.

This was outright money-printing, both in terms of broad money and base money. Mary and Sara are richer, and their banks are bigger. Money was injected into the system, without being extracted from anywhere else in the system, because the deficit spending was financed by the Federal Reserve creating new bank reserves to buy the Treasury bonds (i.e. the deficit spending was "monetized").

The Treasury and Federal Reserve can perform this repeatedly if they want, any number of times, although they both know that if they do it too much, it could cause major consumer price inflation.

Whether it is inflationary for consumer prices, however, depends on whether Mary and Sara still have confidence in the value of their deposits, and whether they go and spend them. It's also potentially inflationary for asset prices; Sara specifically is flush with assets and more likely to use some of her deposits to buy stocks or real estate or gold or bitcoin or collectibles than she was before, which can inflate their prices.

**Example 6: Bank-Financed Helicopter Money**

Example 6 starts exactly where Example 5 left off; both Mary and Sara are happy because they received a second round of extra money.

The pandemic eased a bit, and Mary got a new job, but realizes she needs to keep more cash on hand in case she loses her job again in the future. She learned a lesson about saving.

Sara was already a saver and hasn't been spending extra money yet either. Sara, however, is considering going on a vacation or buying a car now that she's feeling a bit more confident with so much cash. She's also not sure about the value of her money, as she watches the broad money supply expanding so rapidly due to these helicopter checks that everyone is receiving. Car prices are starting to go up, probably due to so many people receiving stimulus checks, so there seems little reason to wait.

However, because the economy is still sluggish, with many people saving more than they used to, Congress decides to do yet another round of \$1,000 helicopter checks to everyone, and issue \$2,000 in new Treasury bond liabilities "TT" to pay for it. This is it, the final stimulus round!

Fortunately for the U.S. Treasury, the banking system has tons of excess reserves due to their previous round of helicopter spending that the Federal Reserve bought with new reserves, and so this time, the banks each agree to buy one Treasury bond "T" with one of their excess reserve blocks. This is depicted in Figure 15-J.

![](media/image32.png){width="3.6in" height="4.5in"}

Figure 15-J

*Beginning State*

System-wide deposits are 6D = \$6,000. System-wide reserves are 5R = \$5,000.

Here's what happens if we imagine the process happening simultaneously. The U.S. Treasury sends Mary and Sara each a \$1,000 deposit "D" block and sends their banks a \$1,000 reserve "R" block each to settle it. The U.S. Treasury then issues two new Treasury bond liabilities "TT" to pay for it. The banks each send a reserve block "R" to the U.S. Treasury in exchange for one of those Treasury bonds "T."

*Ending State*

Mary and Sara are, yet again, \$1,000 richer. They each have yet another deposit block "D" added to their assets.

Their banks have the same number of reserves they started with, because they each received a reserve block "R" from the U.S. Treasury's helicopter deposits to their customers, but since each bank also sent a reserve block "R" back to the U.S. Treasury to pay for the stimulus, they each ultimately received a Treasury bond "T" as an asset instead. They still have the same number of reserve blocks that they started with, but they each have an extra asset "T," and they each have an extra deposit liability "D" for their customers. So, they are a bit more levered overall.

The Federal Reserve didn't change at all from the beginning of this example, although it did some bookkeeping for the reserves moving around and ending back in the same place.

The U.S. Treasury is \$2,000 or "TT" more in debt than it started the example with.

System-wide deposits increased by \$2,000 ("DD") from 6D = \$6,000 to 8D = \$8,000. System-wide reserves are still 5R = \$5,000. So, the money multiplier increased a bit, from 6-to-5 to 8-to-5. Broad money increased, but base money remained the same.

Will it be inflationary for consumer prices? It depends on what Mary and Sara do from here, but most likely at this point, yes. Sara now has tons of cash and is concerned about the value of that cash, so she decides to spend money on a vacation and buy a new car or stocks or real estate or gold or bitcoin --- or something. And Mary decides to eat out at restaurants more now that she has more cash than usual. Other people seem to be doing the same; prices of things are inching up each month since everyone has extra spending money.

There is now \$8,000 in total deposits (broad money) in the system, compared to the start of Example 4 where there was only \$4,000 in deposits. However, the amount of goods and services in the economy has not doubled. So, if Mary and Sara and others decide to start spending their money, it could indeed result in a lot of money chasing a limited supply of goods and services, and therefore could push up consumer prices and be inflationary.

**Summary Conclusions from These Examples**

If we analyze these six examples for how money is really "printed" within a fiat currency system, we can make several observations:

- Banks can create new deposits and increase the number of deposits (broad money) in the system by making new loans. Lending creates deposits. This lending doesn't change the amount of base money (e.g., bank reserves and banknotes) in the system, but it moves those reserves around from one bank to another, and levers up those reserves so that there is a higher ratio of claims (bank deposits) for base money than there is base money in the system. This is the money multiplier ratio, which refers to the ratio of broad money to base money. Although the banks can create new deposits and increase broad money by lending, and although this can be inflationary for prices due to the growth of broad money, it is not quite "money-printing" because the banks are simply making decisions regarding how much to lever themselves up relative to their cash reserve assets. They are also constrained by the possibility of loan defaults, liquidity requirements, and various regulatory standards for how much leverage they can have. The most unstable part of this arrangement is the fact banks make the implicit guarantee that their depositors will be able to withdraw their funds at any time, even though the bank doesn't have nearly enough dollars to cover a sizable portion of their depositors doing so. They provide the illusion of liquidity to an otherwise illiquid system, and this illusion gets shattered every few decades, resulting in more base money being created to support the proliferation of these deposits.

- The Federal Reserve has the power to create new bank reserves, and to therefore increase the total amount of bank reserves in the system. However, if it uses those new reserves to buy existing assets from banks, it doesn't directly lead to more deposits (broad money) in the system. It instead de-levers banks and gives them more capacity to lend and create new deposits (broad money), but whether they will lend or not is up to them. On the other hand, if the Federal Reserve buys assets from nonbank entities like Sara (using the banking system as its intermediary), it can slightly increase deposits (broad money) in the system, but only to a limited extent, based on the limited amounts of nonbank entities' holdings of Treasuries that they can sell. When the Federal Reserve increases the monetary base, it is "money-printing," but it doesn't immediately affect the ability of people to consume more goods and services since it doesn't necessarily increase the broad money supply.

- When authorized by Congress to do so, the U.S. Treasury can give more deposits to somewhere in the system in the form of fiscal deficit spending, but deposits also get extracted back out of the system when nonbank entities like Sara buy the Treasury bonds that are used to fund this fiscal expenditure with new Treasury bond issuance. Therefore, this process doesn't necessarily create new deposits or new reserves. This is what people often refer to as the "crowding out effect," meaning that the U.S. Treasury can extract capital from somewhere in the economy and inject it somewhere else; at a large enough scale it can displace nonbank capital that might have otherwise been used more productively. This is not "money-printing" since it just moves things around and levers up the U.S. Treasury.

- If the U.S. Treasury (on behalf of Congress) and Federal Reserve work together, they can rapidly increase both the deposits (broad money), and bank reserves in the system (base money), without extracting deposits from anywhere in the system. In this process, the U.S. Treasury injects money into the economy by deficit spending, which creates new deposits, but instead of that money being extracted from deposits somewhere else in the economy, the Federal Reserve buys those new Treasury bonds with newly created bank reserves out of thin air, and thus levers itself with additional assets (the new Treasuries) and additional liabilities (the new reserves attributed to the banking system). When this happens, it doesn't matter if banks lend or not: Together, the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve go around banks' lending decisions by just giving people and businesses more deposits (broad money). This outright increases the net worth of Mary and Sara in the examples and increases the size of their banks (including broad money supply and bank reserves, but the banks' equity remains unchanged) and levers up both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. There is no limit to the amount that they can do this, other than the fact that it would eventually be inflationary if done too much and too rapidly relative to the amount of goods and services and productive capacity in the economy. This combination is the most inflationary form of "money-printing," although there are some checks and balances because fiscal changes must be passed by Congress and signed into law by the president of the United States.

- If the U.S. Treasury injects money into the economy with deficit spending, and the Treasuries to finance it are bought by commercial banks, it also increases the deposits (broad money) and increases the money multiplier. This can be done to a significant extent if banks start with excess reserves, because every time the federal government injects more money into the system, it creates more bank deposits, which replenishes the reserves that the bank spent buying Treasuries, and thus gives the banks more ability to buy additional Treasuries. This is rather inflationary, although to maintain leverage ratios and reasonable levels of liquidity, the banks need to start with plenty of excess reserves (which they likely received from prior Federal Reserve quantitative easing programs).

- QE alone, where the Federal Reserve buys existing assets mostly from banks, is an anti-deflationary form of money-printing; it re-liquifies the banking system and fills it up with excess reserves, which helps keep their deposits (broad money) redeemable, rather than letting them default and deflate during liquidity crises. It's not usually outright inflationary for consumer prices because it doesn't usually directly increase the broad money supply by much.

- Large fiscal deficits funded by QE (the central banks monetizing deficit spending by buying any of the excess Treasury bonds that have insufficient demand by the public), is usually inflationary for consumer prices because it gets money directly into the economy, into the broad money supply, and it can be done with no limit except for price inflation that it is likely to cause.
