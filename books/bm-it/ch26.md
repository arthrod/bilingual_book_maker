# Chapter 21: *Bitcoin's Path of Monetization**

Prior to the creation of Bitcoin, anyone who wanted to quickly send value across long distances needed to go through a trusted intermediary --- such as the banking system and their associated central banks. Bitcoin is a powerful innovation that allows people to quickly transfer value in a peer-to-peer manner over the internet, without relying on any centralized third party.

The question then becomes, "What is this capability worth?"

To try to answer that question, let's first back up and look at gold again for a moment.

The key reason why paper claims and banking systems were built on top of gold for centuries was to improve gold's capabilities as a medium of exchange. Gold is good as a savings asset, but due to its limited divisibility, physical nature, and need for authentication whenever it changes hands, it is not great as a medium of exchange in the modern world. Even as a final settlement network, it leaves a lot to be desired. When gold is settled in large amounts using large bars, the only way to truly know that a bar consists of gold down to its core is to melt it down and re-make the bar. If users want to transact with it online or over long distances, they need to abstract it in some way and therefore rely on a centralized custodian and legal chain of custody so that they can trade digital claims for the gold rather than the gold itself.

Bitcoin on the other hand is a bearer asset that is safe to self-custody in large amounts (especially with multi-signature setups) and can be sent peer-to-peer around the world over the internet within minutes. Therefore, it removes the need for custodial abstraction. Some holders will still prefer custodians to hold it for them, but it's not as necessary as it is with large amounts of gold. Thus, the units of the network are less prone to centralization. Bitcoin is a very fast global settlement system; it takes 30-60 minutes to settle a large transaction on Bitcoin whereas most international bank transfers take significantly longer than this. And by writing down or memorizing twelve words, someone can travel anywhere in the world with their bitcoin.

From the start, the Bitcoin network was designed as a peer-to-peer network for the purpose of being a self-custodial medium of exchange. It's not the most efficientÂ way to make small purchases, but it's the most unstoppable way to settle final value online. It has no centralized third parties, no centralized attack surfaces, and sophisticated ways of running it can even get around rather hostile networks. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is harder to attack due to its bigger network of nodes and total amount of miner computation. In addition, the node software is small and tight so that it can be run on a laptop with normal internet bandwidth, which is not the case for most other cryptocurrencies.

At first, bitcoin were mined and held as digital collectibles by enthusiasts, and there was no quotable price for them.[^324] The cost to acquire them was determined by hardware and electricity to run a computer and participate as a miner, and the amount of this input cost per coin varied depending on how many people were using their computers to mine it.

In 2010, the first bitcoin exchanges were created, which allowed a quotable market price to form. This was also the first year of practical use for bitcoin. When Wikileaks was de-platformed by PayPal and other centralized payment methods, it turned to bitcoin donations in their place. Bitcoin's original use-case as censorship-resistant money came to the forefront with this event, and even Satoshi wrote at the time that he was concerned that this would bring negative attention toward them like a swarm of hornets before the network was robust enough to handle it.[^325] Days later, he ceased posting in public, and within a few months he vanished from email communications as well. And yet the Bitcoin network has continued to grow and evolve since then, for well over a decade.

Kind of like how a tank is designed to get from point A to point B through resistance but is not well suited for commuting to work every day, the Bitcoin network is designed to make global payments through resistance but is not well suited for buying coffee on the way to work. More broadly, the Bitcoin network is the world's most immutable and decentralized database for storing the history of bitcoin transactions as well as other arbitrary data, and bitcoin are required to pay transaction fees to update that database.

In that sense, the Bitcoin network has utility, for both ethical and unethical participants (just like any powerful technology). And because it is broken up into 21 million units (each with eight decimal places, resulting in 2.1 quadrillion actual sub-units), it is a finite digital commodity.

And that's how Satoshi described it in a forum post in 2010:

> As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:\
> -- boring grey in colour\
> -- not a good conductor of electricity\
> -- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either\
> -- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose
>
> and one special, magical property:\
> -- can be transported over a communications channel
>
> If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.[^326]

In addition to sending them online, bitcoin in the form of private keys can be physically brought with you globally. You can't bring a lot of physical cash or gold through an airport and across borders. Banks can block wire transfers into and out of their country or even within the country. But if you have bitcoin, you can bring an unlimited amount of value globally, on your phone, on a USB stick, or stored in a password-protected file in a cloud drive that you can access from many different countries --- or simply by memorizing a twelve-word seed phrase (which is an indirect way of memorizing a private key). It's challenging for governments to prevent that without extremely draconian surveillance and control, especially for technically savvy citizens.

This utility combined with an auditable and finite number of coins eventually attracted attention for its monetary properties, and so bitcoin acquired a monetary premium. When you hold bitcoin, especially in self-custody, what you are holding is the stored-up ability to perform global payments that are hard to block, as well as the stored-up ability to transfer your value globally if you want to or need to. You are holding your slot on a global ledger. It could be an insurance policy for yourself in the future, or you could simply hold it because you recognize that capability to be valuable to others, and therefore recognize that you could sell that capability to someone else in the future. And compared to other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the largest, most liquid, most immutable, and most decentralized one.

Furthermore, thousands of developers are working every day to make the Bitcoin network more useful. Some of them are contributing to base layer improvements. Some of them are working on higher parts of the network stack. Some of them are making hardware devices, software applications, or bitcoin-native financial services companies, and all of this work makes holding, transacting, and otherwise interfacing with the Bitcoin network easier and more efficient.

Bitcoin is becoming a rather salable good, in other words. Meanwhile, it settles faster than dollars and has a lower supply growth rate than gold. Figure 21-A shows the dollar-denominated market capitalization of bitcoin over time.

Figure 21-A[^327]

If we catalogue the various bearer asset monies of the world and list the top five or ten in terms of global salability, bitcoin already make the list. If you bring physical Egyptian pounds, Norwegian kroner, South Korean won, Thai baht, or 100+ other paper currencies with you to various places of the world outside of their host jurisdictions, you'll most likely find it very difficult to get anyone to take them in exchange for goods or services, or even to exchange them for local currency (aside from a very small number of specialized dealers who charge high fees and are hard to find outside of airports). The best bearer asset monies as of this writing to bring with you are probably physical U.S. dollars and physical gold coins; in most regions of most countries, you could buy something with them, or at least exchange them for local currency at fair market value with little difficulty. Euros are in the top five as well. Bitcoin is already in the top ten globally salable monies, especially within cities. There are tens of thousands of bitcoin ATMs in urban centers around the world, and many niche businesses in many countries directly accept bitcoin for payment. There are Bitcoin communities and meetups in countries around the world as well. Bitcoin is able to move globally through airports and other ports of entry in a way that cash and gold cannot. There are decentralized social media protocols like Nostr where bitcoin is the standard unit of account and people across the world can easily send it to each other by tipping each other's posts. There are platforms like Bitrefill that let people around the world easily convert bitcoin into gift card vouchers for all sorts of everyday purchases, so that even merchants who don't directly accept bitcoin can still transact with people who primarily use the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin is volatile, but that's in large part because it monetized from zero to more than a trillion-dollar market capitalization at its peak within its first twelve years. The market is exploring this technology and trying to determine its total addressable market as more and more people buy into it over time. It's an asset that is still only held by a small fraction of the global population.

Censorship-resistance is a significant feature when it comes to payments, and the ability to self-custody portable money that cannot be debased is a significant feature when it comes to savings.

To many people in developed countries, those features might not seem important, because we are privileged and take our freedom and comfort for granted. We might even imagine that the only people who would want these features must be up to no good. But for a large portion of the world, being able to bring self-custodied wealth with you if you must leave your country is immeasurably valuable. When Jews fled Nazi-controlled Europe, they had trouble bringing any valuables with them. When people left the failing Soviet Union, they could only bring the equivalent of \$100 USD with them.[^328] When people today want to leave Venezuela, Syria, Iran, China, Afghanistan, or any number of countries, they often have a rough time bringing most of their savings with them, unless they have self-custodied bitcoin, and I personally know some of them that have done this. Even if they just want to stay where they are, people in developing countries all around the world suffer from repeated currency debasement, which makes saving very hard to do. Billions of people today can appreciate the value of this feature.

Vladimir Putin's political opposition in Russia, Alexei Navalny, began using bitcoin after Putin's establishment cut them off from their banking relationships. Nigerians protesting against police violence turned to bitcoin after they had their bank accounts frozen by the government. Chinese people have used bitcoin to transfer value out of the authoritarian country through capital controls. Venezuelans have used it to escape hyperinflation and transfer value out of their failed state. Lebanese citizens, Argentinian citizens, Turkish citizens, and more have used bitcoin to store value in the face of persistent high inflation. People in various African nations have used bitcoin in places where they don't have banking services; today more people in the world have a smartphone than a bank account. Remote workers in various countries can perform online services such as virtual assistance, graphic design, programming, or other services to foreign clients and receive bitcoin as payment with much less hassle than many other forms of international payment.

Aside from usage on the dark web, one of the earliest practical use-cases for bitcoin, back in 2013, was by Roya Mahboob to pay Afghan women with a type of money that their male relatives could not confiscate and that they could send to others. In his book *Check Your Financial Privilege*, Alex Gladstein wrote about this topic:

> At first, Roya paid her employees and the WomanNX contributors in cash. The problem was that the women wanted to send the money to family and pay vendors in different parts of the country. They used the hawala system, an 8th-century money transfer process that relied on brokers and a web of trusted intermediaries.
>
> This ancient platform seemed dated and slow to Mahboob and the women, many of whom already had Nokia cellphones and had started to create and use their own Facebook accounts. Even worse, sometimes the money did not make it through the hawala system, and it was hard to verify that the whole amount reached the recipient.
>
> So, Mahboob researched the idea of mobile money. As it turned out, cellphone-based payment systems like M-PESA, which worked so well in Kenya, never took off in Afghanistan. PayPal was still not available because of U.S. sanctions. And the women did not have bank accounts, so she could not wire them the money. The women had to have their father's or husband's permission to open an account, and this was often not granted.

> In early 2013, Mahboob's Italian business partner told her about bitcoin. He said it was a new kind of money that could be sent from phone to phone without a bank account. Unlike the local afghani currency, which was steered by the government, bitcoin floated on the open market. When Mahboob first learned about bitcoin, it was trading at around \$13. By the early summer of 2013, it broke \$70.

Bitcoin indeed ended up being quite useful for their purposes, where other monies were insufficient. The primary challenge was its volatility, which especially in the early days made it hard to work with as money. And then, in addition to self-custody and decentralized payments, the ability of bitcoin to be brought across borders ended up being critical for some of the women. As Gladstein wrote further in his book:

> A few of the women did keep their bitcoin from 2013. One of them was Laleh Farzan. Mahboob told me that Farzan worked for her as a network manager, and in her time at Citadel Software earned 2.5 BTC. At today's exchange rate, Farzan's earnings would now be worthÂ more than 100 timesÂ the average AfghanÂ annual income.
>
> In 2016, Farzan received threats from the Taliban and other conservatives in Afghanistan because of her work with computers. When they attacked her house, she decided to escape, leaving with her family and selling their home and assets to pay brokers to take them on the treacherous road to Europe.
>
> Like thousands of other Afghan refugees, Farzan and her family traveled by foot, car and train thousands of miles through Iran and Turkey, finally making it to Germany in 2017. Along the way, dishonest middlemen and common thieves stole everything they brought with them, including their jewelry and cash. At one point, their boat crashed, and more belongings sank to the bottom of the Mediterranean. It's a tragic story familiar to so many refugees. But in this case, something was different. Through it all, Farzan was able to keep her bitcoin, because she hid the seed to her bitcoin wallet on a piece of tiny, innocuous-looking paper. Thieves could not take what they could not find.[^330]

The limited scalability of Bitcoin's base layer has not been an issue so far, because there is only so much public understanding and current demand for tank-like censorship-resistant payments and globally portable money. And as development has continued since Bitcoin's launch, the network has branched into additional layers just like any other financial system or protocol stack.

The Lightning network is a series of channels that run on top of the Bitcoin network base layer. It allows for custodial or non-custodial instant payments online or in person with a mobile phone, to the point where they can easily be used to buy coffee, and with practically no limitation on transactions per second. The Liquid network, as another example, is a sidechain that wraps bitcoin into a federated network for rapid transfers, better privacy, and additional features. The Fedimint open-source protocol now allows anyone to set up a federated and private community bank on top of the Bitcoin and Lightning network stack. RSK and Stacks are smart contract layers built on top of Bitcoin that give developers and users more expressive programmability. Smart contracts can be used to make Bitcoin more programmable, which may be able to reduce the overhead costs of certain financial services and make them more globally accessible --- services such as trading, collateralized borrowing, or escrow functionality. There are other proposals such as covenants, drivechains, and zero-knowledge rollups that can scale the Bitcoin network if certain soft forks are enabled as well.

In that sense, bitcoin began as digital collectibles or commodities that had utility value as an internet-native and censorship-resistant medium of exchange for people who need that capability. Bitcoin eventually acquired a monetary premium as an emergent and volatile store of value (an increasingly salable good) and began to be held more and more for their scarcity than for their medium-of-exchange capabilities. And then over time, the network developed additional ways to enhance the network's medium-of-exchange capabilities beyond their initial limitations, and the depth of liquidity has increased over time.

Bitcoin as a network and surrounding ecosystem went through multiple boom and bust cycles so far, and in each one, larger pools of capital became interested in it. In the first era, the user experience was challenging and required technical understanding, so Bitcoin was mainly used by computer scientists and enthusiasts exploring the technology. In the second era, the Bitcoin network became a bit easier to use and bitcoin reached enough liquidity to have a quoted price in dollars and other fiat currencies, and so it became noticed by early speculators as well as dark web buyers/sellers for the purposes of buying drugs and other things, which continued until some key centralized dark web marketplaces were shut down. In the third era, Bitcoin reached early mainstream adoption, in the sense that exchanges with proper security protocols could operate with bank connections, provide more liquidity to the market, and improve the user experience so that everyday people could more easily buy some. In the fourth era, institutional-grade custodians entered the market, which allowed pensions, insurance companies, hedge funds, family offices, small businesses, and sovereign wealth funds to safely allocate capital to bitcoin.

In each era of adoption so far, too much enthusiasm and leverage eventually built up, causing a local bubble to form and to pop, washing out a lot of traders, and setting the stage for the next foundation of growth. Unlike other technologies such as electricity, washing machines, televisions, computers, and phones, a new type of emerging money most likely cannot be widely adopted quickly. This is because if too many people adopt it at once, it drives up the price and incentivizes leveraged buyers to enter it. This leverage eventually causes a bubble to form and to pop, which sets the price back and disillusions people for a while until it builds the next base and grows from there. Due to the attachment of leverage, Bitcoin cannot realistically have a fast and smooth adoption curve like non-monetary technologies can.

There's no guarantee that Bitcoin will be successful in the long run, but to whatever extent that it will be, it's almost guaranteed to be very cyclical along the way, with higher-highs and higher-lows as it repeatedly washes out speculative traders that try to attach leverage to it. Only once it is closer to its total addressable market, with extremely high levels of liquidity and user adoption, can its notorious price volatility realistically diminish.

**The Applicability of Gresham's Law**[^331]

According to Gresham's law, if people have a good money and a bad money with a fixed exchange rate between them (or other frictions such as capital gains taxes placed on the good money), they will usually want to spend the bad money and keep the good money. Ironically then, the bad money is what tends to circulate with high velocity while the good money is hoarded with low velocity.[^332]

This trend emerged multiple times under bimetallic standards. Whenever gold and silver have been fixed relative to each other by government decree, and this fixed exchange rate was not in line with the global supply/demand exchange rate (which can change over time), then the undervalued metal tends to disappear from circulation while the overvalued one circulates.

In a 2011 report for the Congressional Research Service titled "Brief History of the Gold Standard in the United States," Craig Elwell wrote:

> The United States began with a bimetallic standard in which the dollar was defined in terms of both gold or silver at weights and fineness such that gold and silver were set in value to each other at a ratio of 15 to 1. Because world markets valued them at a 15Â½ to 1 ratio, much of the gold left the country and silver was the de facto standard.
>
> In 1834, the gold content of the dollar was reduced to make the ratio 16 to 1. As a result, silver left the country and gold became the de facto standard.[^333]

There are a couple processes for how that happens.

The first process is simply that the better (undervalued) money gets hoarded, and so it stays in the country but gets removed from everyday circulation. Instead, it is treated as a form of savings. People will not usually part with what they perceive as being undervalued.[^334]

The second process is that international entities can observe this and arbitrage it. For example, if the global ratio of gold-to-silver is 15.5 to 1, but Americans have it fixed by government decree at 15 to 1 (slightly undervaluing gold vs silver relative to the global exchange rate), then a European entity can keep selling silver to Americans and buying gold from Americans to arbitrage that difference. As years or decades pass, there will be a lot less gold in the United States, and a significant surplus of silver instead.

The same thing has tended to happen during historical periods of physical coin debasement. If gold coins are initially issued with 90% gold content, but newer coins are issued with only 80% gold content, but the government treats both as having the same legal tender face value and expects their citizenry to do the same, then it will lead to some obvious outcomes. The 90% gold coins will tend to be hoarded domestically or traded to external merchants at their proper metallic value wherever possible, while the 80% gold coins will be spent on domestic commerce, and therefore circulate with high velocity where they are treated at an above-market rate. Eventually, most of the coinage in domestic circulation will be the 80% gold variety.[^335]

The U.S. broad money supply has grown at a 7% annualized rate since 1960. Most developed countries have a similar rate to that, and emerging markets tend to have a much higher rate on average.

![](media/image48.png){width="4.5in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 21-B[^336]

Meanwhile, total supply of bitcoin is growing at less than 1.8% per year, which will fall to below 0.9% in 2024, and to around 0.4% in 2028. The Bitcoin network is programmed to asymptotically approach 21 million bitcoin in total by halving its rate of new bitcoin creation every four years until it has 0% supply inflation. And unlike most other blockchain monies, the wide node network helps ensure that no centralizing force can change this distribution pattern. Plus, it has the dominant network effect among proof-of-work blockchain monies, which makes it rather protected against censorship or transaction-reversal attacks.

![](media/image46.png){width="4.5in" height="3.15in"}

Figure 21-C[^337]

It's natural for people to want to save something like gold or bitcoin, and spend their fiat dollars, pounds, yen, euros, yuan, pesos, naira, and rupees. Assuming both are widely accepted by merchants, money that depreciates in purchasing power tends to circulate, while scarce money that tends to appreciate in purchasing power gets kept as savings, with much lower spending velocity.

This becomes especially true if a jurisdiction treats the harder money like property and taxes each transaction, while enforcing legal tender for the weaker money, which most jurisdictions do. If you try to use things like gold or bitcoin as media of exchange, each transaction is a taxable event compared to your initial cost basis (when you originally bought that asset). The incentive therefore is to hoard the taxable gold or the taxable bitcoin, with their lower levels of supply inflation, and spend the non-taxable fiat currency on consumption, unless someone has a strong need for Bitcoin's censorship-resistant payments properties.

In this sense, although Gresham's law originally applied between monies with fixed exchange rates, I think it can be said to apply more broadly any time there is transactional friction mismatch of some sort, including a tax. The depreciating and/or lower-friction currency will be spent while the appreciating and/or higher-friction currency will be saved, unless there is a strong practical reason to do otherwise, meaning a use-case that specifically needs the unique properties of the appreciating and/or higher-friction currency, such as for example if someone needs to use Bitcoin's censorship-resistant properties or if someone is operating in an environment of limited banking access.

People that don't have banking access but are tech-savvy, people that are facing financial resistance or censorship, or people that have become de-platformed in various ways, are more likely to use bitcoin for their medium-of-exchange capabilities early on in their adoption. Some others use it as a medium of exchange because they want to remove themselves from banks as much as possible or enjoy the ease of making international peer-to-peer payments with it. If a region makes it legal tender or removes capital gains taxes from bitcoin, this makes it more convenient to use in these ways.

On the other hand, people who hold bitcoin but don't actively use it as a medium of exchange yet, are still using it as money. They are holding it for its monetary premium and the future optionality and insurance that this portable, self-custodial, supply-capped, censorship-resistant global money provides to them. Even if they have all sorts of traditional assets and banking relationships, on the side they also are their own bank, thanks to their allocation to bitcoin.

The future remains uncertain, and in chapter 26 I analyze risks for the Bitcoin network and various ways that the network's failure or stagnation could occur. So far, however, Bitcoin continues to gain users, developers, and a flourishing ecosystem of companies built around it, with structurally increasing (albeit very volatile) network value.

**Approaches to Bitcoin Valuation**

The exact numbers change every year, but the value of global assets has been estimated by both Credit Suisse and McKinsey to be worth over \$500 trillion in recent years.[^338] Real estate, equities, bonds, and cash represent most of the assets.

As of the end of 2022, the largest broad money supply in the world was China at approximately \$38 trillion (when translated into U.S. dollars). The United States was the second biggest at \$22 trillion, the euro area was the third biggest at \$16 trillion, and Japan was the fourth biggest at \$12 trillion.

The World Gold Council estimates that there are 208,000 metric tons of refined gold in the world, with two-thirds of it having been mined since 1950.[^339] With gold prices where they were at the end of 2022, that translated into a total gold market capitalization of approximately \$10 trillion.

There are many estimates regarding what the Bitcoin network (and by extension, individual bitcoin) could be worth one day. Chapter 26 covers risks associated with the network and covers scenarios where the network could stagnate and die over time. If none of the failure scenarios occur, it's not unreasonable to expect the network to continue to take more market share, as understanding of it grows and as its user experience improves with new ecosystem developments.

In its nascent state, it's very volatile and prone to leverage and liquidation cycles. The more widely held it is and the more liquid it becomes, the less volatile it is likely to be, which would make it similar to gold in that regard. Unlike most assets that tend to be partially siloed based on jurisdiction, the Bitcoin network has no specific connection with any country or corporation and is available to anyone in the world with internet access.

The total addressable market for the Bitcoin network, therefore, includes everyone that might want to hold some percentage of their net worth in a scarce, liquid, and immutable form that can be self-custodied and that is globally portable. With over \$500 trillion in global assets, every 1% of global assets that the Bitcoin network manages to capture would translate into over \$5 trillion in market capitalization in today's dollars --- which at 21 million coins translates into a fully diluted value of \$238,000 per coin. As a bullish scenario, it's not hard to imagine that at a mature stage for the network, people around the world might on average want several percentage points of their assets in that form of money.

Monies tend to have network effects based on salability. The more liquid, widely held, and widely accepted a certain type of money is, the more useful that money becomes to each user, and thus more people want to hold it and accept it. All else being equal, the more conversion points between bitcoin and goods, bitcoin and services, and bitcoin and currencies there are globally, the healthier the Bitcoin network is. Even if a user doesn't want to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange currently, the more assurances that a user has that they *could* find a buyer anywhere around the world, the more useful bitcoin is to hold as part of their long-term savings. Furthermore, there are some pools of capital that realistically can only use bitcoin once it grows more expensive. When the whole network only had a few million dollars' worth of exchange trading volume per day, billionaires couldn't enter and exit it in size without moving the price. Now that there are billions of dollars of exchange trading volume per day, it's still too small for some of the largest trillion-dollar pools of capital to comfortably enter or exit in size. The network must partially saturate certain types of markets and grow larger from doing so, in order to reach each higher level of adoption.

**What Would a "Bitcoin World" Look Like?**

If the Bitcoin network in some form (a fast money with a fixed supply, based on a decentralized open-source global ledger that is backed up by energy and user-operated nodes, with many software layers and financial institutions built on top of it) reaches critical mass and becomes very widespread in use --- like the dollar is today and like gold used to be --- then this would lead to multiple aspects of commerce and governance working differently than they do within the current monetary system. We can't necessarily know all of those implications, but we can infer some directional outcomes. I view most of the likely outcomes as positive, but as with any new technology, these types of changes can also lead to some outcomes that we might consider to be negative as well.

- Unlike the bimetallic and gold standard banknote era, the underlying asset of bitcoin itself can settle nearly as quickly as transactions can and is inherently divisible into well-defined amounts, and therefore there is no need for unit abstraction. Coinage and banknotes historically served the purpose of providing an abstracted unit denomination for physical metal, which had inherent shortcomings for divisibility and authentication. This fact gave rulers the option to change the abstraction over time. During the latter half of the 19th century, when gold standard advocates (mostly creditors) debated with bimetallic standard advocates (mostly debtors) about the definition of the dollar, it was because the unit of account (the dollar) was abstract from the underlying metal, and therefore by its very nature the dollar could have its definition changed. Choosing what precisely to peg the dollar to has always been a political decision, which could affect the dollar's scarcity and disproportionally benefit either creditors or debtors.[^340] Similarly, in the modern era where central banks can rapidly change the supply of fiat currencies, this can favor creditors or debtors at various times. To the extent that bitcoin is accepted as money, and credit contracts are denominated in bitcoin, then bitcoin is just bitcoin, which is self-defined, highly divisible, and has an intrinsically stable supply. Individuals and businesses can send bitcoin to each other, and while certain layers may use custodial trade-offs to improve efficiency when so desired, the underlying unit of account can function without abstraction.

- Financial middlemen would likely be diminished in terms of wealth and power. Sending and storing money would be more automated and less expensive than they are now. Financial services companies would exist on the periphery of the system rather than the center of the system. With hard money, individuals can focus more on working and saving, and less on complex investment schemes. During the telecommunication era where the speed gap between transactions and settlements existed, the financial system required ever-more complex layers of abstraction and the economy became more financialized over time. As that gap closes due to the proliferation of hard money and fast settlements, both financial abstraction and economic financialization can decrease. Investing would still be a significant activity, especially if securities are tokenized and accessible to anyone with a smartphone, but the need for it would be lessened because the benchmark of outperforming money itself would be much harder.[^341]

- Various custodial and noncustodial payment ecosystems would more seamlessly connect to each other using the Bitcoin/Lightning open-source protocol stack and be able to settle with each other nearly instantly, much like how people can currently send emails between different webmail providers (e.g., Gmail and Yahoo) due to those providers using the same shared open-source email protocols. Today, methods of connection between different domestic financial ecosystems such as PayPal and Cash App leave a lot to be desired, and to send a sizable international payment often requires going through an expensive and opaque series of transfers and currency conversions between correspondent banks. These siloed, piecemeal financial ecosystems can be connected to each other with fast and efficient open-source protocols, much like how various parts of the internet function today. As of this writing, Cash App is already integrated into the Bitcoin and Lightning protocol stack.

- With the ease of accessing a bitcoin wallet and even running a network node for normal people, peer-to-peer transactions can occur more globally. Anyone can pay anyone else if they have internet access. Borders become less relevant. Value can flow faster and more easily between nations, which would likely reduce the frictions that small countries face when transacting with the rest of the world. This could unlock economic value in Africa (which has over 40 different currencies) and Latin America (which has over 30 different currencies) compared to the current and historical baseline, since their citizens would more easily be able to save money and participate in global commerce. Globally, the average size for government structures might shrink and become more local, since there may be less advantages to being a large country than there are today. There would likely still be large regional power structures and alliances of various forms.

- Credit denominated in bitcoin would exist for highly productive financing and short-term liquidity, but most long-duration loans denominated in a unit of account with a fixed supply would not make productive sense. The idea of households carrying 30-year mortgages, giant corporations carrying debt as a permanent part of their capital structure, and governments carrying permanent rolling debt balances, would make less sense than they do within the current system if the underlying unit has a finite supply. Overall debt-to-equity ratios would likely diminish, and the world would be more based around equity.

- Due to both high speed and finite supply, it would entail significant risk to hold demand deposits in fractional reserve bitcoin banks. Interest rates above the rate of money supply growth are inherently risky or illiquid, and in the long run, the supply growth for bitcoin is zero. Providing time deposits or otherwise engaging in investment contracts to earn yield from Lightning liquidity or productive credit would still make sense for investors that want yield and are willing to take on credit risk and/or illiquidity risk to earn it.

- Income taxes within the current system rely on ubiquitous financial surveillance to be enforceable. If it becomes commonplace for people to send money peer-to-peer, including globally, and there are a large variety of privacy tools to make transactions hard to track, then it may become untenable for governments to tax incomes as their primary source of revenue. Taxes might have to revert more to how they were in the 19th century --- when transactions were inherently more private --- meaning that wealth taxes on real estate, excise taxes on select goods or ports of entry, sales taxes on physical establishments, income taxes on large and well-audited businesses, and fees for government services, would likely need to become the primary sources of revenue. Administrative and tax overhead costs would likely be reduced, especially for individuals and businesses that don't have a big physical footprint.

- People have historically been willing to deal with weak money if it's faster than gold, but if weak money doesn't even have a speed advantage relative to harder money alternatives, then in a world of widely accepted bitcoin it would likely become harder for governments to convince their people to accept fiat currencies for payment and hold large amounts of value in them. Gresham's law dominates until the weaker money is basically useless. At that point, Thiers' law takes over, which observes that good money drives out bad money. A payee generally wants to pay for goods with weaker money, and a merchant generally wants to sell their goods for stronger money. If a weaker money gets bad enough that merchants won't even accept it, that is when Gresham's law gives over to Thiers' law.[^342] The prospect for government seigniorage would likely diminish, and so governments would need to rely on more transparent methods to fund their activities rather than diluting the savings of their citizenry in opaque ways.

- Savings would be more globally portable. This would make it easier for refugees to bring their savings with them if they need to flee a problematic region to a better region, but it could also give wealthy oligarchs with shady business practices more geographic discretion on where to operate. Jurisdictions would likely need to compete more directly to draw in and retain highly portable capital.

- Stranded energy sources would be universally monetizable. Variable sources of power could become more economically useful if they have bitcoin miners attached to soak up periods of excess supply. It may become more commonplace for human settlements to form around naturally occurring energy sources, rather than energy needing to be brought to human settlements, especially since certain types of remote work can be done from anywhere.
