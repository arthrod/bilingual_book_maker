# Chapter 20: **The Creation of Stateless Money**

In 1984, Nobel laureate economist Friedrich Hayek said in an interview:

> I don't believe that we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government. Since we can't take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can't stop.[^307]

That kind of statement sounds extreme at first, but when we remember that there are approximately 160 currencies in the world, and most of those rapidly lose value and have little acceptance outside of their own monopoly jurisdictions, then it may suddenly seem less extreme.

Government and money often go together in modern history, but much like government and religion, they need not be inherently connected. And even if they are connected, it need not mean that there can't be private alternatives. In plenty of developing countries, people repeatedly turn to dollars or gold for some degree of stability rather than rely entirely on their local unstable currencies.

For decades in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, programmers looked for ways to create stateless digital money using cryptography over the internet, with varying degrees of temporary success that ultimately ended in failure or stagnation. They did, however, build the foundation for what would come later.[^308]

In 1982, the computer scientist and cryptographer David Chaum published his dissertation at Berkeley called "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[^309] It was about how several entities who don't necessarily trust each other can maintain a shared database together, using cryptographic techniques. In 1983 he invented e-cash, which used a cryptographic technique he developed called "blind signatures" to enable private electronic transactions, where even the parties processing the transaction don't get to see the details but are able to process them by using mathematical proofs.[^310] In 1989, he founded a corporation called DigiCash to commercially pursue this opportunity. However, it was not successful; he achieved limited merchant and user adoption and was unable to bootstrap a self-reinforcing network effect. In 1998 DigiCash went bankrupt, and in 1999 Chaum was quoted in a *Forbes* article saying, "It was hard to get enough merchants to accept it, so that you could get enough consumers to use it, or vice versa."[^311] He also noted that transaction privacy was not in very high demand as more users joined the internet and the average level of user sophistication decreased.

In 1989, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was developed. Most people reading this are familiar with the various error codes associated with this protocol, with "HTTP 404 Not Found" being the most well-known. We've all run into it at some point: It's the error that someone gets if they try to go to a webpage that doesn't exist, often due to a typo or a page that has been removed. Fewer people are familiar with the fact that another original error code is "HTTP 402 Payment Required." The 402 error code was reserved for future use when it was created, for some sort of digital cash in the future. For decades it went mostly unused, even in the era of e-commerce, since online payments were still ultimately run by banks with an internet overlay rather than being digitally native.

In 1996, Gold and Silver Reserve Inc. (G&SR) launched e-gold, which allowed users to open an online account on their website, and these accounts were denominated in grams of gold. Users could instantly transfer value to other accounts, including down to a fraction of a gram. At its peak, it reached over 5 million accounts and \$2 billion worth of annual transfer volume. However, by the 2000s they began to face legal challenges. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. federal government passed the Patriot Act, which among other measures tightened regulations around being a money transmitter business. The U.S. federal government ended up suing the company, and by 2009 the operation was shut down.[^312] This event emphasizes the problem of gold that I described in earlier parts of this book: To move around quickly, gold needs to be abstracted by a centralized custodial entity, and that entity can be corrupted or shut down.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several advancements were made around the topic of digital scarcity. In 1997 Adam Back created Hashcash, a proof-of-work system that was meant to limit email spam and denial-of-service attacks. The idea of proof-of-work is to use computation techniques that require significant computational power to produce some sort of digital token or certificate, which is then easy to verify as genuine by any party once the token or certificate is presented. Nick Szabo subsequently proposed Bit Gold, which was the idea of using this type of unforgeable costliness to create an online scarce asset. Hal Finney then incorporated both Hashcash and the idea of Bit Gold into a 2004 invention called Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW). Using a centralized server, Finney turned Hashcash into a reusable token, a type of verifiably scarce digital collectible, which he called RPOW tokens.[^313] There were other types of digital currency proposals around this time as well, but this specific Back-Szabo-Finney development path was particularly important.

The limitation that most of these monetary projects all shared was that they were centralized. DigiCash as a centralized company failed to build a network effect. E-gold was quite successful until it was shut down by the government. RPOW tokens relied on a centralized server.

In 2008, an unknown developer or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto implemented some of these techniques in a decentralized way. On October 31, 2008, Satoshi introduced a paper called "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" to a cryptographic mailing list that included several of the above-named individuals, among many others.

The abstract was as follows:

> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they\'ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.[^314]

The paper, only nine pages long, was written in an academic form, with eight citations for a variety of cryptographic and timestamping techniques, including a citation for Adam Back's Hashcash. Over the next few weeks, various cryptographers on the email list reviewed it and asked questions, mostly critically and skeptically, which were politely replied to by Satoshi.[^315] The emails are public record now and reading through them feels like reading a dissertation defense, with articulate questions and articulate answers between professionals.

At no point did Satoshi promise riches or come off like a salesman. He wrote like an academic, although he made it clear that the goal of this work was freedom, in the ethos of the cypherpunk movement.

For example, one person on the mailing list wrote, "You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography." Satoshi responded with, \"Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own."[^316]

Satoshi then released the open-source code on January 9, 2009, and mined the first set of blocks. In the genesis block, he referenced a topical newspaper headline about British bank bailouts during the heart of the global financial crisis:

> The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks[^317]

Hal Finney publicly announced in a tweet on January 10 that he was running the Bitcoin software, and he subsequently received the first test transaction from Satoshi.[^318]

For the first two years of Bitcoin's existence, through 2009 and 2010, Satoshi continued to provide updates for the code and discussed various concepts with early users, keeping with his calmly spoken and matter-of-fact persona. In late 2010, Satoshi disappeared and made no more public posts, leaving the project in the hands of others.[^319] As of this writing, nobody has been able to conclusively prove who he was. There has been a rolling participation of developers for the Bitcoin network ever since.

Bitcoin is a distributed public ledger that some people have referred to as "triple entry bookkeeping." It's a protocol that allows all participants around the world to come to a consensus on the state of the ledger every ten minutes on average. Anyone with a basic laptop and an internet connection can participate in the network as a node operator by running a free and open-source software application, and doing so allows them to send and receive transactions without the permission of any centralized entity. Miners receive transaction fees and newly created bitcoin for processing new blocks of transactions on the network (updates to the ledger), using proof-of-work and timestamping, and node operators check to ensure that those new blocks of transactions are following the rules of the network. Since the ledger is highly distributed and relatively small in terms of data, node operators can store a full copy of the ledger and constantly reconcile it with the rest of the network. Users can keep their own private keys, which along with node applications is what allow them to move coins (or fractional coins, typically called "sats," short for "satoshis") from their address to someone else's address on the ledger without using any third-party custodian. Alternatively, people can choose to trust a custodian with their keys if they prefer, and thus interact with bitcoin similarly to how they interact with a bank account. The total number of bitcoin that will eventually exist is 21 million, and they are divisible into a total of 2.1 quadrillion sats.

This is an incredibly powerful concept. A bitcoin holder can memorize twelve words (representing their private key) and bring her savings with her anywhere in the world, without relying on a centralized counterparty. Bitcoin is a decentralized ledger, existing across the world in a decentralized cloud of computers, that is costly to attack and impossible to unilaterally change the rules for. There is no centralized server and no centralized issuer. It's completely transparent, meaning that every line of code is public. Developers can collaborate to create and propose updates for it, but there is no way to push updates to users; updates can only be freely accepted by users and must be backward-compatible if they want to remain part of the existing network.

In addition, Bitcoin closes the speed gap between transactions and settlements that I've described several times in this book. Ever since the invention and deployment of intercontinental telecommunication systems in the second half of the 19th century, transactions have been able to move around the world at the speed of light, while scarce, self-custodial bearer asset money (e.g., gold) could only be transported and verified at the speed of matter. This speed gap opened a massive arbitrage opportunity for banks and governments to use, because it gave them custodial monopolies over fast long-distance payments. Bitcoin represents the first significant way to settle scarce value at the speed of light, since once bitcoin are sent across the network and are settled under a few blocks on the blockchain, they are irreversible --- unless over 50% of miners on the network (which are dispersed all around the world) try to reverse it. A bitcoin is a scarce asset that is not someone else's liability, much like a gold bar, and this ability to quickly move a non-liability asset over long distances is something that the world has never had before.

In Chapter 8 I discussed William Stanley Jevons' 1875 description of a centralized world clearing house, allowing all entities to settle with each other quickly. And although his vision increasingly came into being, starting with its center in London and then shifting to New York, the problem was that this centralized world clearing house was based on abstraction and debt and therefore allowed for significant mismanagement of the ledger. Bitcoin can serve as a *de*centralized world clearing house, because rather than relying on abstraction and debt, the bearer assets themselves can be settled directly between entities within minutes.[^320]

It\'s not an accident that it took approximately a century and a half after transactions were enabled to occur at the speed of light for bearer asset settlements to also occur at the speed of light. This process was path dependent, similarly to how the invention of the bicycle in some form would necessarily come before the automobile. Credit-based transactions over telecommunication systems only require simple data like Morse code to occur, and thus could be performed in the 19th century. Settlements of scarce value over telecommunication systems require far more complex computation, data structures, bandwidth, and mathematical proofs. Bitcoin and the broader ideas of digital scarcity and a decentralized digital settlement network were invented nearly as early as they could have been, based on the developmental timing of the underlying technologies that they rely on.

If I were to describe in one paragraph why money has been *broken* around the world for so long while almost everything else has improved substantially (energy abundance, technology abundance, and so forth), it's due to this gap between transaction and settlement speeds that the telecommunication era created. For a century and a half, the world has been stuck in a local maximum that has required and incentivized ever more complex forms of centralized abstraction to bridge that gap. The international gold standard worked for several decades during peacetime but was inherently flawed from the start due to how many claims it enabled to exist on such a small monetary base of actual gold, and it failed its first test as soon as war broke out between major powers in Europe. The Bretton Woods system was even more flawed due to even greater levels of abstraction and managed to fail in less than a decade and a half after full implementation. The modern system of 160 different ever-devaluing fiat currencies loosely tied to one world reserve fiat currency is highly flawed due to having no inherent grounding in scarcity. The invention of Bitcoin as an open-source fast settlement network with its own scarce units provides the first credible way to close that gap between transaction and settlement speeds, and now it's a matter of researching it and testing it to see if it's robust enough to serve that purpose at a large scale for the long run.

**Bitcoin Technology Overview**

Satoshi summarized Bitcoin in a forum post in February 2009, approximately one month after its release. There have been thousands of articles and many books written about Bitcoin since then, but I think Satoshi's own description remains useful for its clarity:

> I\'ve developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It\'s completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. Give it a try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:
>
> Download Bitcoin v0.1 at <http://www.bitcoin.org>
>
> The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\'s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.
>
> A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.
>
> It\'s time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.
>
> One of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital signatures. A digital coin contains the public key of its owner. To transfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of the next owner. Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big problem unsolved: double-spending. Any owner could try to re-spend an already spent coin by signing it again to another owner. The usual solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model. In its central position, the company can override the users, and the fees needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.

> Bitcoin\'s solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for double-spending. In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin. It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle. For details on how it works, see the design paper at <http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf>

With that description in mind, the following paragraphs go into more detail for how the Bitcoin network works. Readers don't necessarily have to understand all of this, and the deeper details are more complex than this, but it's helpful to run through the intermediate-level details; I'll do my best to keep it in plain language. In this book, I capitalize the word "Bitcoin" when referring to it as a network and leave it uncapitalized when referring to "bitcoin" the monetary unit (unless of course it's the first word in a sentence).

Bitcoin began as a genesis block and a downloadable open-source software application, created by Satoshi, that people can use to run their own node on the network. The genesis block and all blocks after it leave a cryptographic puzzle (which is just a giant hidden number) that can only be solved by repeatedly guessing the answer by using processing power (which people typically refer to as "mining" but could perhaps more accurately be referred to as "timestamping"). Any person can contribute processing power from their computer to begin guessing to solve this puzzle, although in practice specialized SHA-256 processors are exclusively used now due to their efficiency. The person that finds the answer to the puzzle can connect a new block (filled with transactions) to the previous block and is rewarded with transaction fees and a certain number of newly generated coins for doing so, which serves as an incentive for people to dedicate processing power for this purpose. This new block also creates a new puzzle to continue the process and create the next block.

The Bitcoin network uses public-key cryptography. A user randomly generates a private key, which is simply an enormous number. You can generate a key by flipping a coin 256 times, for example, but in practice most people use software "wallets" to generate one for them. There are more possible private keys than there are atoms in a million galaxies, so the probability of randomly generating one or guessing one that someone else has already generated is vanishingly small.[^322] In more human-readable form, the private key can be stored or memorized as a twelve-word seed phrase. The private key can be used to create a public key and an address, and other users can send bitcoin to that address. The public key and address are derived from the private key, but the process does not go in reverse; nobody can derive the private key from the public key or address. The private key, known only to the user, allows the user to sign a transaction to send bitcoin (including fractions of bitcoin) from their address to someone else's address.

Once initiated and signed by the owner of a private key, a pending transaction (the movement of bitcoin from their own address to someone else's address, or even from multiple of their own addresses to multiple different addresses of other people) is propagated to the network of other user nodes. Each node maintains a queue of pending transactions called a "mempool" (short for "memory pool"). Each node also maintains a full history of all prior blocks and the transactions therein since the genesis block. Therefore, each node contains the full ledger and the full history of the ledger since inception. A miner (or pool of miners) that successfully solves the puzzle left by the prior block can look through their pending transaction queue and pick ones to add to the new block that they create. Each block can hold a few thousand transactions, depending on the complexity of the transactions. Senders of a transaction must include a transaction fee for the miner with their pending transaction. If there are more pending transactions in the queue than there is space in the block they are creating, a miner will typically put the highest-fee transactions into the block in order to maximize the revenue earned from that block. During busy network times, higher transaction fees will generally get a pending transaction into a block more quickly than a pending transaction with a low fee attached to it. Miners that successfully create a block are rewarded by the network with a block subsidy (a certain number of new coins created per block), as well as transaction fees from all the transactions they include in the block.

Once created, the miner sends the newly created block to the node network, and nodes verify that the block follows the rules of the network, such as the maximum amount of data that can be put into each block and the maximum number of new coins (block subsidy) that the miner can create for themselves when creating the block. If a node determines that a block is valid, it stores it and propagates it to other nodes, and within a short period of time, all nodes verify and store this new block. The full history of all blocks and their transactions is commonly known as the "blockchain," and it is stored on each user node. There are tens of thousands of nodes worldwide, each storing the full ledger including all prior transactions from genesis.



Figure 20-A

If two miners solve the latest puzzle at roughly the same time, it creates a temporary chain split. Some nodes will see Miner A's "block A" first, and other nodes will see Miner B's "block B" first, and these nodes will send these blocks to their peer nodes. Some miners may begin trying to solve the puzzle left by "block A," and others may begin trying to solve the puzzle left by "block B," based on which block happens to be propagated to them first. Eventually, a miner solves one of them, let's say for "block B," and that becomes the bigger blockchain than the "block A" one. As this fact is propagated around the network, that becomes the new dominant blockchain, "block A" gets discarded as an orphaned block, and the chain split is resolved back into one consensus ledger. Nodes are programmed to consider the biggest blockchain that follows the network's rules to be the correct blockchain to continue building upon.

All Bitcoin transaction settlements are probabilistic, but in practice a transaction is considered increasingly "final" as it is buried under many blocks, since it would take an increasingly huge amount of work to create a set of blocks built on some prior block that is larger than this version of the blockchain. A transaction that is in just one block has some chance of being reversed if it turns out there is a near-simultaneous bigger chain out in the network somewhere. A transaction that is two or three blocks deep is much less likely to be reversed. A transaction that is six or more blocks deep is almost certainly never going to be reversed. These numbers may change in the future if there are attempted censorship attacks or double-spending attacks on the network by well-capitalized attackers, resulting in users waiting longer to confirm their transactions. The larger and more important a transaction is, the more important it is to wait for several blocks to be built on top of the block that includes that transaction.

The network monitors the speed at which new blocks are added to the blockchain, with the goal of adding a new block every ten minutes on average. If more computational power joins the network and begins guessing the puzzle and trying to mine bitcoin, then blocks will be added faster. If some of the computational power leaves the network, then block creation will slow down. Every 2,016 blocks (approximately two weeks), the network checks the average speed of new block creation and adjusts the difficulty of the mining puzzle to reset it toward ten-minute average block times. This way, no matter how much computational power joins or leaves the network, the network continues to produce a block on average every ten minutes.

The more nodes there are on the network, the more decentralized the enforcement of the network ruleset is and thus the more resistant it is to undesired changes. The more computational power there is on the network, the more costly it is for an adversarial entity to attack the network by purposely reversing prior transactions, or by censoring new transactions. If some entity or group of entities is able to achieve and maintain over 50% of the computational power on the network (which currently requires billions of dollars' worth of equipment and electricity to do), they have the ability to censor the network in whatever way they like, but they still cannot change the rules of the network as enforced by the node operators that run the network. Users of the network could respond to this attack by bringing more computational power onto the network and try to reclaim a 50% majority of beneficial participants to un-censor it.

Developers from around the world can contribute proposed updates to the Bitcoin node software, which is what users run when they decide to operate nodes. A volunteer revolving team of maintainers organizes, reviews, and publishes updates, which node operators can then review and choose to upgrade to, or not. There is no way for developers to force node operators to make an update. As of this writing, there is one primary implementation of Bitcoin node software, referred to as Bitcoin Core. However, other implementations of Bitcoin node software from different people do exist and are compatible with each other and with Bitcoin Core. Since the code is open source, it's possible to fork away from the existing dominant implementation of Bitcoin Core and go in another direction, if the node operators of the system determine that the developers associated with that existing implementation are no longer serving their interests.

A "client update" involves small changes to Bitcoin Core or other Bitcoin client applications. As operating systems change over time, it's necessary to keep the client software compatible with them. A client update doesn't change the consensus rules of the Bitcoin network, but instead mainly just updates other parts of the software that makes it easier and safer to run a node.

A "soft fork" is a backwards-compatible change to the consensus rules of the network, meaning that nodes that upgrade to this software can continue to interact on the same network as older nodes that haven't updated yet. Specifically, a soft fork narrows the existing consensus ruleset slightly. An example of a soft fork would be to reduce the maximum block size, since any blocks created under this new update would meet the prior maximum block size rules, but now the rules are also a bit stricter. Bitcoin has historically updated using soft forks, which optimized the code and have added some new features. As an analogy, USB 2.0 devices are compatible with existing USB 1.0 ports but offer some new features for those that choose to upgrade to USB 2.0 ports. Similarly, USB 3.0 devices are compatible with existing USB 2.0 (and earlier) ports but offer another level of features from there.

A "hard fork" is a non-backwards-compatible change to the consensus rules of the network, meaning that any node that upgrades to this software is no longer using a ruleset that is compatible with the rest of the network. An example would be to increase the block size limit, since blocks made using this software will not meet the maximum block size that older nodes have in their rulesets and won't be accepted by the network. Other examples of hard forks would be to increase the number of coins in the system, or to increase the future pace of new coin creation per block. Existing nodes would automatically reject blocks with these characteristics. As an analogy, it's like introducing a different and incompatible communications protocol than USB, and that doesn't work with existing USB ports.

A non-compatible update, i.e., a hard fork, creates a separate ledger network, with much fewer nodes, and much less computational power, and won't be recognized as Bitcoin by the existing node network (unless the vast majority of individual nodes and miners together decide to upgrade to that new non-compatible ruleset). When a hard fork happens, the ledger is effectively copied, and so each existing private key holder retains their bitcoin on the existing ledger and in addition has access to an equivalent number of forked coins on the new ledger. From there, the outcome of hard forks is determined by market forces: Each existing holder now has both sets of coins, although it's likely that the minority fork will have considerably less market value. The history of all transactions prior to the fork are the same for the two ledgers, but starting with the point where the fork occurs, the ledgers can begin to diverge due to different new transactions being added to each one. If a user has a high conviction about which fork will win, they could sell the other set of coins and buy more of the coins associated with the fork that they think will win. If a user has no strong opinion, they could hold both sets of coins and wait for the fork to be resolved and wait for the value on the minority fork to be re-absorbed into the main network. There have been many hard forks out of the main Bitcoin network, and as of this writing the biggest one only has around 0.5% of the market capitalization of the main Bitcoin network. The incumbent fork is the one that is already compatible with the existing node network, which gives it an inherent advantage at winning competitions with new hard forks that are not.

Bitcoin was programmed by Satoshi to produce 50 new coins every ten minutes on average to a miner that creates a successful block, and then every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years) that number of new coins per ten minutes is halved. After four years it became 25 coins every ten minutes, and then four years later it was 12.5, and then four years later it was 6.25, and so on. This declining block subsidy was programmed into the software from inception. The way the math works out is that the network asymptotically approaches 21 million coins, with nearly 19.5 million already having been created as of this writing.



Figure 20-B[^323]

While some of this may sound complex at first, it's not nearly as complex as the step-by-step details of how the global banking system works under the surface, including the complex handshaking that goes on between financial entities to process dollar transactions and the overnight credit arrangements between financial institutions via dollar repurchase agreements and similar contracts. The base layer of the Bitcoin network is straightforward in comparison, and most of it is abstracted from users. The fact that a full node can run on an aged laptop speaks to how simple it is at the foundation; the Bitcoin network is just a swarm of these relatively simple nodes, programmed to operate with each other and come to an agreement on the state of the ledger every ten minutes. The details described here, however, are important to potential early adopters as they try to determine whether this network is likely to be successful, or what this type of technology can mean for the concept of money going forward.

These days, there are many types of signing devices and phone wallet apps that allow users to easily manage private keys, addresses, and node functions without having to worry about what's going on under the hood --- kind of like how the owner of an automobile doesn't need to be a mechanic. These products are created by various teams and companies around the world; anyone can create new products and services for users if they are compatible with the open-source Bitcoin network.

There is a big spectrum for how technically involved users can choose to be when interacting with the Bitcoin network. If someone runs their own node and holds their own private keys, they can audit the supply of the network, participate in network consensus, initiate peer-to-peer transactions, and retain privacy, with no centralized third-party interactions. Unless someone gains control of over half of the computational power on the whole network (or shows up at their door with force), nobody can stop a node operator from sending or receiving transactions. They can use various privacy and anonymization techniques, and directly run software associated with other layers of the network as well.

A step down from there is that someone can keep their own private keys but use a node that is run by a third party. This sacrifices some privacy and auditability, but at least they can custody their own coins, and at any time they could begin to run a node if they want to. This is a middle ground that gives people a significant amount of optionality to get more involved over time.

Another step down from there is that someone can use a custodial service to hold their private keys for them. There are custodial wallet apps and custodial financial services companies that will hold bitcoin for clients and allow clients to easily send bitcoin around. This is a very convenient method, but it introduces privacy problems and counterparty risk, including potentially not being able to withdraw coins or not being allowed to send coins to an address that the client wants to send them to. There are some new technologies like the Fedimint open-source protocol that allow for automated and private custody arrangements.

There are also hybrid solutions, thanks to multi-signature technology. The digital signature required to send bitcoin from an address can be broken into pieces, where for example two out of three are needed to sign a transaction. This is useful for additional security or estate planning. Someone can keep one key with them, keep a second key somewhere separate and safe (perhaps with a trusted relative or legal representative or kept in an encrypted, password-protected file somewhere), and keep a third key with a bitcoin-native financial services company. This gives some protection against losing one key and gives the user some benefits of a custodial service without giving the custodian the full ability to control their coins. This type of hybrid custody is impossible with cash, gold, and other types of non-encrypted money.

As we finish the chapter we should ask "who controls the ledger?" for Bitcoin.

The primary answer is that the tens of thousands of users that run nodes control the ledger, and anyone with a basic laptop (or similar hardware) and a standard internet connection can join as a node operator. Node operators are the ones that store the full history of the ledger, and collectively maintain the software that runs the network and enforces network rules for new blocks being added to the blockchain by miners.

The secondary answer is that miners play an important role in updating the ledger. Miners use electricity and specialized processors to earn the right to add new transactions onto the ledger. A single miner or group of miners that somehow marshals together over 50% of all active computational power on the network could censor transactions or reverse recent transactions that users previously thought were final. They could censor specific transactions, or they could attack the network by mining empty blocks to censor all transactions going forward. If this happens, it's not necessarily a permanent problem; more computational power could be brought online by users of the system, incentivized by a spike in transaction fees by censored users, to collectively regain over 50% of the network's computational power.

Developers are influential but have no direct power over the ledger since they can't force any node operator to accept a software update. If developers make an update that node operators don't like, then that update won't be accepted by them. In that case, node operators will just keep running their existing software, and eventually could support other developers to create different updates. Many node operators wait years after an update is released before using it, to ensure that it is fully stable and without bugs. Developers are, of course, still important for the network; their expertise at crafting backward-compatible updates that the users of the network want to use has helped Bitcoin become more secure and scalable over time. Developers consist of an ever-changing set of volunteers (many of which are financially supported by companies in the ecosystem), and they ensure that the node software continues to be compatible with modern computing environments that evolve over time.

Unlike banks, central banks, and fiat currency financial systems, there is no entity that can unilaterally debase the Bitcoin ledger. There is no central node that can create a million new coins for themselves. Nobody can take a user's coins unless they get their private key (which can be further secured by passwords and/or multi-signature protection) or unless they coerce them to send over their coins. The ledger is transparent, objective, and secured by real-world resources in the form of electricity and specialized processors.
