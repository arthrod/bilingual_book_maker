# Chapter 9: **Printing Money for War**

World War I started much like any other regional conflict, but quickly expanded into a global war at a scale never previously seen, resulting in tens of millions of deaths and unimaginable suffering.

In 1914, the Archduke of Austria, Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip, because Princip was associated with a group that wanted to free Bosnia from Austria-Hungary's control. Austria-Hungary subsequently declared war on Serbia, and Russia determined it was in its interest to come to Serbia's defense --- in large part due to Russia's desire to strengthen its influence in the region. As these events unfolded, Germany had a pre-existing military alliance with Austria-Hungary, and France had a pre-existing military alliance with Russia, so Germany and France quickly got involved as well. The United Kingdom did not want to see Germany defeat France and gain power across continental Europe, and so under considerable political pressure, the United Kingdom chose to join the war on the side of France and Russia even though the Eastern European conflict on its surface had nothing to do with their own citizens or island nation.

In the years leading up to the war, the United Kingdom was the dominant global power, and the issuer of the world reserve currency. The United States represented a rising power --- technically the world's biggest economy by then --- but the United States was far across the ocean and maintained a rather isolationist policy toward the rest of the world at the time. Germany represented a more direct rising power competitor, with rapidly strengthening industrial prowess on the same continent as the United Kingdom, at a time when the United Kingdom's global dominance was past its prime. There was considerable trade between the United Kingdom and Germany, and many people at the time thought that war between them was unthinkable. The prior several decades had seen considerable peace across Europe, during which time countless trade connections and business relationships had been built.[^140]

The problem for any country is that war is expensive, unless that country is successful and greedy enough to become an empire, conquer their enemies, take their gold, and turn them into vessal states that pay recurring tribute. It's especially hard to sell to the public the idea that the government needs to raise domestic taxes to go fight a war between different foreign nations in foreign lands for some sort of vague national strategic advantage.

So, the United Kingdom issued war bonds in 1914 to raise capital from the public to go fight the war, and these war bonds paid interest rates that were higher than the prevailing government bonds at the time. These war bonds were widely reported as being massively oversubscribed. Newspapers described capital pouring in by the patriotic public to support the government in its war efforts and to earn good returns at the same time.

The problem, however, was that the story wasn't true. In 2017, over a century later, researchers at the Bank of England found in their archives that it had all been a cover-up. *Bank Underground* is a blog written by staff at the Bank of England, and they published a 2017 piece called "Your country needs funds: the extraordinary story of Britain\'s early efforts to finance the First World War" that described the truth. Their piece began with a summary:

> Financing World War I required the UK government to borrow the equivalent of a full year's GDP. But its first effort to raise capital in the bond market was a spectacular failure. The 1914 War Loan raised less than a third of its Â£350m target and attracted only a very narrow set of investors. This failure and its subsequent cover-up has only recently come to light following research analysing the Bank's ledgers. It reveals the shortfall was secretly plugged by the Bank, with funds registered individually under the names of the Chief Cashier and his deputy to hide their true origin. Keynes, one of a handful of officials in the know at the time, described the concealment as "a masterly manipulation."[^141]

In other words, when the government went to the public to raise capital, money merely trickled in rather than poured in, despite the higher interest rates that were offered. A narrow set of wealthy investors centered around London allocated some capital, but it wasn't nearly enough, and the government found itself lacking the required funds for war. As the article describes, allowing the public to know the truth would have been disastrous for the government's finances and the public perception of the war:

> Disclosure of the failed fund raising would have been "disastrous" in the words of John Osborne, a part-time secretary to Governor Montagu Norman, in a history of the war years written in 1926. Copies of this account were only given to the Bank's top three officials and it was decades before the full version emerged. Revealing the truth would doubtless have led to the collapse of all outstanding War Loan prices, endangering any future capital raising. Apart from the need to plug the funding shortfall, any failure would have been a propaganda coup for Germany.

So, the Bank of England secretly paid for the rest of the war bonds, and lied to the public that the government's issuance of war bonds was a massive success. Specifically, the Bank of England loaned currency deposits (created out of thin air) to two members of its senior staff, who then went and bought large amounts of the bonds. The government was then able to spend significant money into the economy that they had not actually withdrawn from the economy through either taxes or war bonds. Therefore, the money supply was greatly expanded by manipulating the public ledger.

Barry Eichengreen in his book *Globalizing Capital*, described it as follows:

> To mobilize resources for the war, the authorities imposed new taxes and issued government bonds. When the resources so mobilized proved inadequate, they suspended the statutes requiring them to back currency with gold or foreign exchange. They issued fiat money (unbacked paper) to pay soldiers and purchase war materiel at home.[^142]

In the subsequent years, inflation ravaged the country, and greatly devalued the purchasing power of the government's debt, including the war bonds. Both the broad money supply and the consumer price index more than doubled over a five-year period, which inflated away much of the debt that was used to create that new money in the first place. The actual public buyers of the war bonds, and anyone holding British currency or bonds in general, ended up being the ones who lost considerable purchasing power.

Figure 9-A shows the degradation of the pound with the war, and how it never recovered.

The deficits and debts were monetized in the 1910s. Rather than withdraw gold-redeemable currency from the population in a transparent way using taxation and borrowing to spend on the war, the government and central bank instead worked together to secretly print massive amounts of new currency and used that currency to spend on goods and services for the war. The vast divide between the number of claims for gold and actual gold in the financial system that Jevons described in his 1875 book *Money and the Mechanism of Exchange* was exploited by centralized authorities in the most complete way possible. This was the first real test of such a centralized system, and it immediately failed the test. As a result, the savings of the average British household were devalued by over half within a handful of years, and the redeemability of the currency for gold was defaulted on. The government and central bank manipulated their centralized national monetary ledger so that the public paid for the war through their savings, even if they didn't buy the war bonds voluntarily, and even if they didn't have a transparent war tax involuntarily placed on them. The resulting devaluation of savings was therefore both involuntary and opaque.

From there, the government began controlling nearly every aspect of life. They forced businesses to stop producing things for the domestic economy, and to shift to producing things for the war effort instead. They froze rents to try to contain price inflation that their own expansion of the currency caused in the first place. As that same 2017 *Bank Underground* article goes on to describe:

> Faced with the possibility of catastrophic defeat, Britain threw overboard its centuries-long embrace of free market principles in several areas. It demonstrated a previously unseen willingness to interfere in private ownership of industry and property. It demanded that industries produce required goods, imposed rent freezes on private property, rationed imports and ultimately confiscated its own citizens' foreign securities (Archive: 8A240/1)\.... But even this wasn't enough. In January 1915, the Treasury prohibited the issue of any new private securities without clearance, and UK investors were banned from buying most new securities (Morgan (1952)).

The *Financial Times*, which in 1914 had helped spread the false news that the war bonds were oversubscribed, issued a correction in 2017 in response to the newly discovered archives of what really happened. Their correction was titled "A correction 103 years late: How the BoE covered up failed war bond sale" and began with a summary that got straight to the point:

> Clarification: On 23 November 1914, a piece published in the Financial Times claimed the UK government's War Loan was "oversubscribed", with applications "pouring in". The item described this as an "amazing result" that "proves how strong is the financial position of the British nation". We are now happy to make clear that none of the above was true.[^144]

Of course, the United Kingdom wasn't the only country that printed money for the war. Every combatant country did, on both sides. When the United States later entered the war in 1917, they did so with printed money as well. The losing sides of the war mostly saw their currencies hyperinflate away, while the winning sides of the war merely had "very high" inflation rather than outright hyperinflation.

What made it particularly notable that the United Kingdom engaged in this monetary expansion, however, was that they were the world reserve currency at the time. Many countries around the world held part of their sovereign reserves in the United Kingdom's government bonds, partly voluntarily for the benefit of efficiency, and partly by coercion under a system of colonialism. Not only did the United Kingdom devalue their own citizens' savings for the war effort, but they also devalued the purchasing power of many developing countries that were not otherwise involved in the war at all. Global value, from all around the world, was drained by centralized decree from savers and channeled toward war in continental Europe.

The speed and ease with which this occurred was only possible due to the abstraction of gold as money. If people and nations were primarily holding physical gold or silver as money, it would be much harder to pry that money from them and channel it toward the war. The debasement of physical coinage has always been a theme historically, but the physical aspect of it provides an inherent limit in terms of how fast the debasement can occur. But because people and nations were merely holding paper claims and bank deposit claims for gold, promises could be quietly severed overnight with the stroke of a pen, while the consequences could be dealt with later and spread over time.

The ability and willingness of governments to print money for war or other crises spread like a virus. Thanks to centralization and abstraction of money, governments were no longer constrained by the amount of gold in their vaults; they could tap into the savings of their entire citizenry. If one government could drain their citizens' wealth quickly and non-transparently for war, then it increased their odds of winning --- unless their opponent nations did the same. The ability of the issuer of the world reserve currency to drain value from countries all around the world was even more powerful. Countries willing to sacrifice the long-term to win in the short-term had an advantage.

This is why I argue that the global failure of the gold standard was inevitable due to a technological mismatch, and why it eventually failed practically everywhere all at once, rather than just in some places. The easier it is to manipulate a ledger, the more likely it is that it will be manipulated. A centralized gold-backed paper currency and banking system is easy to manipulate, since currency can be printed first and the consequences such as the inevitable inflation and breaking of the gold peg can be dealt with later.

John Maynard Keynes, who had described the Bank of England's secret financing of the war bonds in 1914 as a "masterful manipulation," went on to write about the dangers of currency debasement shortly after the war:

> Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth.
>
> Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become \"profiteers,\" who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.
>
> Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.[^145]

Throughout the war, countries around the world showed that their governments and central banks now had nearly complete control of the ledgers that people around the world used for savings and payments. Savings could be rapidly devalued in a non-transparent way and channeled toward what the government considers worthwhile to spend money on. Countries including the United Kingdom went on to re-establish gold pegs several years after the war but broke them again in the 1930s. They then began permanently shifting away from any gold redeemability of their currencies whatsoever, toward a practice of constant money supply dilution. Direct usage of gold by the public to try to bypass this practice was too slow and inconvenient, and in some countries was criminalized.

Keynes, in his essay that is partially quoted here, wrote in extraordinary clarity about the dangers of using a ledger that other people control, even though he himself was a proponent of doing exactly that. Involuntary taxes are one thing --- at least people can see what they are and respond accordingly if needed. The involuntary devaluation of savings in an arbitrary and opaque way is another thing entirely, and this new capability represented a tremendous power shift from those who *use* the ledger to those who *control* the ledger.
