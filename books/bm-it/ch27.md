# Chapter 22: **Cryptocurrencies and Trade-offs**

Once Satoshi Nakamoto showed the way with the invention of Bitcoin as the first persistently functioning and decentralized cryptocurrency network, thousands of other cryptocurrency developers followed in his wake. They all wanted to modify the concept in some way, to explore new rulesets and features for different purposes or optimization goals. And although Satoshi never spent any of his coins as far as anyone can tell (the coins that are believed to have been mined by Satoshi to bootstrap the network in its infancy have been sitting transparently dormant on-chain since he mined them in 2009 and 2010, through multiple cycles of massive appreciation and massive price crashes), many later cryptocurrency founders do want to personally get rich from their own creations.

It's often said that a blockchain is just an inefficient database, and that's basically correct. Users in this context are willing to accept inefficiency relative to other types of software applications to ensure decentralization. Nodes must broadcast every change to the network and keep track of broadcasts from elsewhere in the network.

A blockchain, especially the truly decentralized variety, is a database that is small and tight enough that thousands of entities around the world can store it on their local devices and constantly update it peer-to-peer using an established set of rules. Each node provides validation to ensure that a new block is following the rules of the protocol, and they will only accept and propagate a new block to other nodes if the new block follows the rules. A very large number of user-run nodes helps ensure that the ruleset is immutable, whereas if there are only a handful of nodes, then it only takes a small quorum of people to rewrite the rules of the network.

Plus, the easier a node is to run, the more private, auditable, and permissionless the network is for a regular user. More specifically, the act of running a node gives each user the financial self-sovereignty to privately send and verify their own transactions, and audit the details of the network, rather than rely on any trusted third party. Not everyone will do it, but the barrier of entry for those that choose to do it is low.

A fully centralized database has fewer limitations because it doesn't need to be small and tight. A large service provider can have an utterly massive database contained in a server farm. That can make things run very efficiently, but unlike a blockchain, outside entities can't directly audit it for content and changes; they have no way of stopping the owners of that centralized database from doing whatever they want with it.

So, every blockchain network that claims to improve something compared to Bitcoin on its base layer makes multiple trade-offs to do so. I think it's natural for the market to explore multiple wrong answers to see in practice what the right answers are, and part of what allows me to analyze these concepts is the historical track record of why and how various cryptocurrency projects failed to accrue value. The following sections represent a list of some of the major trade-offs that cryptocurrencies tend to make compared to the Bitcoin network.

*Trade-Off 1: Transaction Throughput*

To increase the number of transactions that can be processed per unit of time on the base layer, either the block size or the block speed needs to be increased. However, increasing either the block size or the block speed increases the bandwidth, processing, and storage requirements of running a node, and if those variables are pushed too far, it puts running a node out of the reach of a normal person. And, if the requirements to run a node grow faster than the rate of technological growth in terms of bandwidth, processing, and storage, then it leads to a shrinking node set over time, which centralizes the network.[^343]

*Trade-Off 2: Privacy*

To increase privacy, some degree of auditability needs to be sacrificed. One of the key things about Bitcoin is that any node can tell you the exact bitcoin supply and maintains the entire history of transactions and the full state of the ledger. That's not possible to the same degree in a privacy-based blockchain. Cryptocurrencies that are private at their base layer make it easier for undetected inflation bugs to occur. In addition, if a privacy-based system doesn't have a serious network effect, its privacy likely isn't as good as advertised because the anonymity set is very small and is therefore somewhat trackable. Privacy is in large part a function of liquidity, and if liquidity is lacking in various privacy-focused ecosystems, then their privacy potential is limited. Various privacy techniques have been built into layers on top of the Bitcoin base layer, which allow for private usage of the network.

*Trade-Off 3: Code Expressivity*

To increase code expressivity (e.g., to execute complex smart contracts right on the base layer), a network must also increase the bandwidth, processing, and storage requirements of full nodes, which makes running a full node harder and thus risks centralizing the network over time, as previously described. In addition, base layer computational capabilities increase the complexity and number of possible attack surfaces on the network. It also opens more opportunities for miners or validators to front-run others and play games with transaction ordering, in a process known as "maximal extracted value," and this tends to lead to centralized block constructors dominating the market.

*Trade-Off 4: Energy Usage*

In a proof-of-stake system, transactions are verified, and new coins are generated, by those who "stake" their coins, rather than by energy-intensive miners. Replacing the proof-of-work consensus with a lighter proof-of-stake consensus requires accepting a circular validation process. In other words, the existing coin holders are determined by the state of the ledger, and the state of the ledger is determined by the existing coin holders --- a perpetual motion machine based on circular logic that doesn't have high fault tolerance. Since there is no unforgeable costliness associated with the history of a proof-of-stake ledger, it is nearly costless to make an infinite number of copies of the blockchain with different transaction histories. If the network temporarily goes offline for any reason, there is no way other than governance decisions and/or centralized checkpoints to determine which ledger is the "real" one to restart from. A proof-of-work system uses energy as that external arbiter of truth, which creates a history with unforgeable costliness, and is what makes the system robust.

Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and whose development of Hashcash in the 1990s was cited by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper, had this to say about Bitcoin trade-offs in a 2021 interview:

> There's something unusual about Bitcoin.
>
> So, in 2013 I spent about 4 months of my spare time trying to find any way to appreciably improve Bitcoin, you know, across scalability, decentralization, privacy, fungibility, making it easier for people to mine on small devices... a bunch of metrics that I considered to be metrics of improvement. And so I looked at lots of different changing parameters, changing design, changing network, changing cryptography, and, you know, I came up with lots of different ideas --- some of which have been proposed by other people since.
>
> But, basically to my surprise, it seemed that almost anything you did that arguably improved it in one way, made it worse in multiple other ways. It made it more complicated, used more bandwidth, made some other aspect of the system objectively worse.
>
> And so I came to think about it that Bitcoin kind of exists in a narrow pocket of design space. You know, the design space of all possible designs is an enormous search space, right, and counterintuitively it seems you can't significantly improve it.
>
> And bear in mind I come from a background where I have a PhD in distributed systems, and spent most of my career working on large scale internet systems for startups and big companies and security protocols, and that sort of thing, so I feel like I have a reasonable chance --- if anybody does --- of incrementally improving something of this nature. And basically I gave it a shot and concluded, 'Wow there is literally, basically nothing. Literally everything you do makes it worse.' Which was not what I was expecting.[^344]

Bitcoin has been successful in large part due to its widely distributed node network, simplicity, robustness, and the associated concept of "monetary self-sovereignty." Anyone with an old laptop and basic internet connection can run a node, use the system relatively privately, initiate transactions themselves, and verify the whole system from genesis. Node requirements increase more slowly than computer processing, data storage, and internet bandwidth do, which means even decades from now, it will still be possible for individual users to run a node. The requirements to run a node increase more slowly than the technological increases in bandwidth and storage, which means that a node gets easier and more accessible to run over time. As a result, Bitcoin is designed to likely get more decentralized over time, in contrast to most other cryptocurrencies that are likely to get more centralized over time.

If developers want to change something about Bitcoin, their changes cannot be forced onto users' nodes. Bitcoin's ruleset is determined by the network of existing nodes. Any changes to Bitcoin in practice must be backwards-compatible upgrades, which node-users can voluntarily upgrade into if they want to, while still being compatible with older nodes. Unless they can gain overwhelming agreement from the users, any attempted upgrades by developers that are not backwards-compatible with the existing node network are merely hard forks --- they create separate new coins that lack a network effect and lack serious security.

Trying to do a hard fork from Bitcoin is conceptually like copying all the data from Wikipedia (it's not that much) and hosting it on your own website, but then getting very little web traffic because you don't have the millions of backlinks that point to the real Wikipedia or the volunteer army of people that constantly update the real Wikipedia. Your split version of Wikipedia would be inherently worse than the real one from the moment you copy it. Similarly, any minority hard fork of Bitcoin inherently has far fewer nodes and far less miner computation, making it less decentralized and less censorship-resistant from the start.[^345]

If nodes had much higher requirements to run, then only large entities could run a node, and the set of nodes would be much smaller. A consortium of miners, exchanges, custodians, and other large entities could agree to make changes to the network. And if that's the case, then the properties of immutability and decentralization are lost for the network. In particular, the 21-million finite supply of coins could be changed, and the censorship-resistant properties would be threatened.

What gives bitcoin its "hardness" as money is the immutability of its network ruleset, enforced by the vast node network of individual users. There's basically no way to make backward-incompatible changes unless there is an extraordinarily strong consensus among users to do so. Some soft-fork upgrades like SegWit and Taproot make incremental improvements and are backwards-compatible. Node operators can voluntarily upgrade over time if they want to use those new features.

Proponents of newer cryptocurrencies often criticize Bitcoin for being old technology, when in reality it's just strict about the trade-offs that it was designed with, and was built to maximize security and decentralization over other attributes. Protocol-level technologies, once established, tend to last a very long time. Internet Protocol was invented in the 1970s; Ethernet was invented in the early 1980s; Universal Serial Bus was invented in the 1990s. All of these protocols are still going strong, and will likely remain strong for decades to come, because they are foundational, and they upgrade over time. They have entrenched advantages from network effects and can upgrade in a way that preserves their backwards compatibility.

Bitcoin, in many respects, looks like these types of long-lasting protocol technologies with dominant market share. It's foundational. It's elegantly simple and robust. Its entrenchment comes from backward compatibility --- any attempt to make a non-consensus hard fork inherently creates a weaker, less decentralized, less secure, and less liquid rival that is unlikely to be able to compete.

But that still leaves us with a potential dilemma. If only minor updates are realistically possible, and most major types of improvements would lead to unacceptable trade-offs, how can the Bitcoin network scale? With only a few tens of millions of payments possible per month due to limited block space and deliberately slow block times, how can the network potentially scale to a billion users, if there is indeed such a time that so many people want to use the network?

The answer is layers. Most successful financial systems and network designs use a layered approach, with each layer being optimal for a certain purpose.

**A Layered Design**

If one blockchain network layer is attempting to be used for all purposes, it makes too many sacrifices to be useful for almost anything in the long run. This can be described as scaling horizontally.

However, if each layer of the system is optimized according to certain variables to serve a specific purpose (throughput, security, speed, privacy, expressivity, and so forth) then the full network stack can optimize for multiple use-cases simultaneously without making unacceptable trade-offs. This can be described as scaling vertically.

The Internet Protocol, to take one obvious example, stacks functions in four layers. The top layer is the Application Layer, which includes a variety of different protocols for formatting information. Below that is the Transport Layer, which is typically either TCP or UDP. Below that is the Internet Layer, with IPv4 being the historical protocol and IPv6 being what the world is aiming to upgrade to. Below that is the Link layer, which consists of Ethernet and other physical networking details. The top layers tend to have more options depending on the task at hand, while the bottom layers are the foundational things that everyone uses.

For a financial example, in the United States we have Fedwire as a gross settlement system between banks. It currently performs fewer than 20 million transfers per month (approximately 200 million per year) but settles over \$80 trillion in value per month (approximately \$1 quadrillion per year) because the average transfer size is massive, and each of these settlements represents a batch of many smaller payment transactions.[^346]



Figure 22-A

Individuals don't directly use the Fedwire base layer. Instead, we use payment methods like credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, Cash App, and so forth, and our banks record those transactions on their ledgers and then settle with each other later. Each Fedwire transfer represents a batch of many smaller transactions from these higher layers.

In other words, there is the underlying core settlement system, and then layers on top of it to offer more throughput, capable of performing billions of transactions per month.

Bitcoin's ecosystem has evolved in a similar way, except in an open and peer-to-peer manner. Fedwire is a centralized and closed domestic settlement layer. Bitcoin is a decentralized and open global settlement layer, and with its own underlying finite unit of account. Bitcoin is in many aspects like gold and Fedwire wrapped into one system, but decentralized and open source.

Bitcoin's base layer has the capacity to process up to approximately 400,000 transactions per day, although each transaction can have multiple outputs, resulting in over one million individual payments per day. That's a few tens of millions of payments per month, or a few hundred million payments per year, which is a bit more than what Fedwire currently handles.

From there, layers can be (and have been) built on top of it to give it more throughput or more capabilities.

As the most important example currently, the Lightning network is a series of 2-of-2 multi-signature smart contracts that run on top of the Bitcoin base layer. These channels are peer-to-peer and can support many transactions over time for each base layer transaction. The trade-off is that the channel must be kept online to protect the funds and receive payments.

For a second example, the Liquid network is a federation of dozens of entities that wraps bitcoin in tokens called L-BTC, and from that point, L-BTC is faster to move around, has better privacy, and can support smart contracts including various other types of security tokens that run on top of it. Many L-BTC transactions can therefore be contained within two BTC transactions (one to peg in, and one to peg out). The trade-off is that the user must trust the federation, which is more decentralized than trusting a single entity but less decentralized than trusting Bitcoin's raw base layer. Most of Liquid's functionary federation entities would need to collude against the system in order to steal user funds. Along similar lines, there is also an open-source protocol called Fedimint that allows people to deploy their own smaller and more private community federations, which are like customizable community banks.

As a third example, RSK is a merge-mined layer that wraps bitcoin into tokens called RBTC, and from that point, RBTC serves as the basis of a smart contract ecosystem.

As a fourth example, Stacks is another layer for smart contracts on top of Bitcoin. Its design has changed over time, with the current goal of implementing collateralized peg-ins and peg-outs with a separate equity token, which has caused some controversy but represents a different incentive structure compared to federations of known and trusted entities.

As a fifth example, there are proposals for covenants that allow certain bitcoin to be assigned with temporary programmable restrictions. Covenants, which would require a soft fork if they are to become active on the Bitcoin network, allow for some programmable lock-ups and layered designs.

As a sixth example, there are various current and prospective roll-up methods. These are data compression techniques that can allow for more transaction throughput and/or better privacy. Some of them exist now, and other ones would require a soft fork to become active on the Bitcoin network.

As a seventh and more detached example, any proof-of-stake system that regularly inserts its checkpoints into the Bitcoin blockchain is in some sense a sidechain of Bitcoin.

From there, custodians can operate in layers above that for people that want them. Exchanges, payment applications, banks, and so forth can all provide services to users that are willing to trust them with a portion of their funds. This can scale Bitcoin usage to any arbitrary level. Each node on the Lightning network doesn't necessarily need to be one person; it could be a custodian or federation with thousands or millions of users.

For example, Cash App is a mobile payment service with tens of millions of users operated by Block, Inc. that allows users to transfer money to one another using dollars or bitcoin. It connects to both the Bitcoin base layer and the Lightning layer, and thus gives users many options. Cash App users can send dollars or bitcoin to other Cash App users for free, since it just consists of Cash App updating their centralized internal ledger. Users can also send or receive bitcoin outside of the Cash App ecosystem by making use of the fact that Cash App is connected to the Bitcoin/Lightning network stack. External transactions by Cash App users can include exchanging value with other people that don't use Cash App or those who are taking self-custody of their bitcoin.

In the current fiat financial system, users of the system cannot really choose which layer they interact with. They can't directly use Fedwire, for example. They can choose which brand of payment service that they use, and all their options consist of centralized, higher-layer payment services that settle on deeper, centralized layers such as Fedwire.

When interacting with the Bitcoin network, however, users can choose to use whichever layer or layers makes the most sense for their specific needs. The Bitcoin base layer is ideal for large, censorship-resistant, irreversible settlement transactions that nobody can control, and for significant, long-term savings. It provides the most security and reliability but comes with limitations regarding transaction speed and transaction throughput. The Lightning layer is ideal for smaller and faster transactions, with greater privacy, and can also be used in a censorship-resistant way. Various sidechains may be used for multiple different reasons, including preferences toward trusting a federation (rather than a single centralized entity) in return for several optimizations related to speed, privacy, and programmability. And on top of all that, custodians, federations, and other centralized or semi-centralized financial services companies may be used for convenience and optimization. For example, someone could use a Fedimint wallet for sending or receiving Lightning payments like a checking account while keeping most of their bitcoin in cold storage on the Bitcoin base layer like a savings account, with occasional transfers between the two.

What makes open protocols powerful is that they allow applications to interface with each other without even knowing that they do. For example, each email provider doesn't need to ensure that their software works with every other specific email provider; they just need to make sure they use the common email protocols. Similarly, each Bitcoin-related application can interact in various ways with other Bitcoin-related applications even if they aren't aware of each other, simply because they are using the same underlying protocol stack. This contrasts with current payment networks that mostly function as closed, non-interoperable systems. Bitcoin and Lightning as a layered network can serve as the open-source connective tissue between any payment ecosystem that elects to connect itself with it.

An open protocol with a network effect, therefore, has immense scaling potential because so many different companies and individuals can build on it. Bitcoin is the first instance in history of a major monetary protocol that can be openly built upon, and that therefore can be exponentially enhanced by developers with new ideas, and that can be connected to by all sorts of different payment ecosystems to make them interoperable with each other.
