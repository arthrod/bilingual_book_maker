# Chapter 12: **Pushing Chaos to the Periphery**

For several centuries and up through the first half of the 20th century, large portions of the world existed under European colonialism. Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and other European powers claimed vast stretches of land on foreign continents. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, many of those regions regained independence from these European powers, but vestiges of that colonialism remain today.

In many ways, the Bretton Woods monetary system and subsequently the Eurodollar/Petrodollar monetary system represent forms of monetary neocolonialism, with the United States in charge. Wealthy nations near the center of the system optimize their ledgers for their needs, especially in terms of suppressing inflation and volatility. However, destroying volatility usually carries a cost and it tends instead to be pushed somewhere else, or only temporarily suppressed until it comes out all at once. In this case, wealthy nations tend to push their inflation and volatility toward developing nations who sit at the periphery of the system, and those developing nations can do little other than take it. Developing nations are expected to attach themselves to the ledgers of the advanced nations, with no recourse for when those ledgers fluctuate in ways that harm them.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has three official mandates, even though they refer to it as the "dual mandate."[^172] The first is to maximize long-term U.S. employment. The second is to maintain stable prices, which they currently define to be 2% increases in average prices per year. The third is to maintain moderate long-term interest rates. A fourth informal mandate is to maintain U.S. financial stability because that is an important requirement to support the first three official mandates.

The reader should notice that despite being the issuer of the world reserve currency, none of the Federal Reserve's mandates say anything about foreign countries. As the issuer of the world reserve currency, U.S. monetary policy decisions affect almost everyone in the world, but the Federal Reserve only officially cares about foreign impacts if those impacts can bounce back and affect the United States' economy.

One of the key things that broadly separates developed countries (which are the minority in terms of population) from developing countries (which are the majority), is that developed countries mostly have their debts denominated in their own currency, while developing countries have a significant portion of their debts, both at the government level and the corporate level, denominated in major foreign currencies like dollars and euros. For example, Japan as a developed country has the vast majority of its government and corporate liabilities denominated in Japanese yen, which they are able to print more of as needed, while Brazil as a developing country has a significant portion of its government and corporate liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars, which they have no ability to print more of and which fluctuate severely against their own currency and cash flows.

This is because companies and governments in developing countries have substantial need for debt financing, but foreign investors mostly do not trust the domestic ledgers of developing countries. A French lender, for example, usually does not want to lend money to a Brazilian company in Brazilian currency, because the Brazilian central bank could print a ton more of that currency. Instead, the French lender to a Brazilian company would rather lend money in U.S. dollars or in euros, which have a stronger track record. And if they do lend in Brazilian currency, it would be at a much higher interest rate in order to compensate them for taking on so much developing country currency risk. Only advanced economies, with entrenched network effects and a long history of semi-credible monetary management, have been able to issue most of their debt in their own currency and have it be trusted by foreign counterparties.

The problem, therefore, is that many developing country governments and corporations have their assets and revenue streams denominated primarily in their local currency but have a large portion of their liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. If the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly relative to their local currency, then their liabilities grow in purchasing power relative to their assets and income streams. This causes economic pain, substantial volatility, or outright sovereign defaults in some cases. It also contributes to a vicious cycle, because having foreign currency debt adds risk and volatility to developing country currencies, and that risk and volatility in their currencies is why they generally have to issue debt in foreign currencies. Very few countries in the Petrodollar era have successfully made the transition from a developing country that relies on foreign currency debt to a developed country that is able to exclusively issue debt in its own currency.

Figure 12-A shows the U.S. dollar's purchasing power relative to a basket of major foreign currencies. As the reader can see, sometimes it goes up 50-100% in value in a short period of time. The fluctuations against developing market currencies are even more severe. This hardening of the dollar puts a ton of pressure on developing countries when it happens.



Figure 12-A[^173]

The first spike in dollar strength in the mid-1980s heavily contributed to the Latin American debt crisis, which led to defaults, currency crises, and decade-long economic depressions for several Latin American countries. The second dollar spike in the late 1990s and early 2000s heavily contributed to the Asian Financial Crisis and Russian default, which led to significant economic pain for much of Asia overall. The third dollar spike in the late 2010s and early 2020s squeezed many countries around the world, and especially countries like TÃ¼rkiye, Argentina, Lebanon, and several African nations. As U.S. policymakers try to tighten or loosen monetary policy to smooth out the U.S. economy, they push volatility and economic pain toward developing countries.

In contrast, whenever the dollar weakens significantly, it hurts creditor nations that have large dollar surpluses and low dollar debts, such as Saudi Arabia or China. If countries store their sovereign reserves primarily in U.S. Treasuries, and those Treasuries underperform inflation, then they are basically paying tribute to the U.S. by financing its deficit spending at negative inflation-adjusted interest rates.

Altogether, a spike in the dollar relative to other currencies is bad for debtor nations, and a decline in the dollar relative to other currencies (or relative to real goods and services) is bad for creditor nations. The U.S. Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury Department can purposely strengthen or weaken the U.S. dollar whenever they feel that it serves their goals. If they are experiencing price inflation, they can raise interest rates, reduce the amount of base money in the system, and cause a sharp tightening of financial conditions and a strengthening of the dollar. If they are experiencing disinflation and economic stagnation, they can cut interest rates, expand the amount of base money in the system, perform fiscal stimulus, and cause a sharp loosening of financial conditions and a weakening of the dollar. If they see that many countries have a lot of dollar-denominated debt, they can purposely tighten financial conditions and strengthen the dollar to cause a lot of economic pain. A developing country with too much dollar-denominated debt will generally experience economic contraction, reduced resource usage, and potentially default. This can reduce resource inflation in the United States, and the United States could then swoop in to help save them with dollar loans, subject to the United States' own conditions and influence --- up to and including deals to put U.S. military bases in their country for geopolitical purposes.

In many cases, the governments of developing nations bring pain to their own people. They mismanage their economies, restrain social and economic freedoms, fail to build strong institutions to decentralize power, and thereby contribute to social and economic stagnation. However, their job of managing their financial systems is made much harder by the fact that a significant portion of their liabilities are denominated in a unit that a foreign power (the United States) can strengthen or weaken whenever it serves their interests to do so. Managing a two-currency system like developing country leaders must do is inherently harder than managing a one-currency system like wealthy country leaders must do.

**The IMF and World Bank**

When developing countries run into currency crises and defaults, the International Monetary Fund swoops in with offers of dollar financing. The IMF was created along with the World Bank in 1944 as part of the Bretton Woods system of U.S. monetary dominance, and while it is ostensibly a supranational entity, it is under significant influence by the United States. Both the IMF and World Bank are physically headquartered in Washington D.C. and in many ways, they have served as guardrails for the Bretton Woods system and the Eurodollar/Petrodollar system since their inception. The United States holds unilateral veto power over major decisions for both institutions.[^174] The World Bank is traditionally run by an American and the IMF is run by a European, but both are firmly controlled by the United States and its close allies. The IMF helps countries deal with balance of payments problems, while the World Bank provides funding for infrastructure development. Joining the IMF is a requirement for a country to join the World Bank, and joining the IMF requires a country to pay money into it.

To receive IMF loans, a developing country must agree to all sorts of terms, which often include deliberate currency debasement to suppress domestic wages and make their exports more competitive.Â Wealthy, advanced nations that control the IMF get to dictate terms to those receiving the loans. Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Foundation, wrote a critical book about the IMF and World Bank in 2023 called *Hidden Repression: How the IMF and World Bank Sell Exploitation as Development*.[^175] In the well-researched book, he summarized some of Cheryl Payer's work that described the primary reforms that the IMF requires when they hand out loans:

1. Currency devaluation.

2. Abolition or reduction of foreign exchange and import controls.

3. Shrinking of domestic bank credit.

4. Higher interest rates.

5. Increased taxes.

6. An end to consumer subsidies on food and energy.

7. Wage ceilings.

8. Restrictions on government spending, especially in healthcare and education.

9. Favorable legal conditions and incentives for multinational corporations.

10. Selling off state enterprises and claims on natural resources at fire sale prices.

The reader should notice that the United States and other wealthy nations often skip these steps when they have their own crises. Rather than trim spending on healthcare and education during a period of economic contraction, they expand it. Rather than raise taxes during periods of economic contraction, they tend to cut them as a form of stimulus. They often maintain protectionist trade policies for themselves, even as they tell developing countries to open their countries for foreign trade. While wealthy nations rarely turn toward financial austerity themselves, they expect developing nations to turn toward financial austerity whenever they face economic contraction, to play along with the global financial system as it is currently structured.

The combination of telling developing countries to shrink access to domestic bank credit while enticing multinational corporations to enter their market with various tax incentives, is particularly toxic. Shrinking domestic bank credit makes it harder for smaller, local businesses to survive and grow. Meanwhile, tax incentives and partnerships with multinational corporations gives those multinational corporations big opportunities to come into the market at a moment of weakness to take market share from those local businesses. This happens repeatedly in cycles.

Many developing countries around the world have received well over a dozen IMF loans since the institution was created. Old debts get restructured and refinanced and rolled over into new ever-expanding debts. In many cases, countries have paid back their loan value many times over due to high levels of interest, and still owe more money than they originally borrowed.

Furthermore, large portions of the original loans get quickly funneled back into U.S. and European companies, while sticking the developing country with the bill. For example, the World Bank may lend money to developing countries to build a railroad and a port, who then hire U.S. and European and Japanese infrastructure firms and pay them to design and build much of the work, using this money that they borrowed. The money flows as a loan from the developed countries, briefly to the developing countries, and then back to the developed countries' corporations --- while the developing countries get stuck with the debt, owed to developed countries. The railroad and the port are then used primarily to transport and export natural resources from the developing country to the developed countries that financed this, from which the local developing country population received little value but was saddled with the debt for the project. When the debt comes close to defaulting, the loan is generally restructured, and the local currency (and thus the savings and wages of their people) is sharply devalued.

What makes this worse is the fact that many of these developing countries have corrupt, authoritarian rulers. The IMF and World Bank frequently make deals with these authoritarians who control their own country's local fiat ledger, and those authoritarians generally siphon off a significant chunk of money for themselves and their cronies to live in luxury while storing their wealth in offshore bank accounts and real estate. Most people in these countries have no say in the process, generally see little benefit from the deals, and yet get stuck with debt and austerity and currency devaluation that they never signed up for in the first place. Even if the authoritarian leader is eventually removed from power, the IMF still generally expects the country to repay the loans, even if they had no input into receiving those loans in the first place.

In his 2011 book *Debt: The First 5000 Years*, David Graeber described what occurred when France made Madagascar an outright colony from 1895 to 1958, and it is just one of many such examples:

> In 1895, for example, France invaded Madagascar, disbanded the government of then-Queen Ranavalona III, and declared the country a French colony. One of the first thing General Gallieni did after \"pacification,\" as they liked to call it then, was to impose heavy taxes on the Malagasy population, in part so they could reimburse the costs of having been invaded, but also, since French colonies were supposed to be fiscally self-supporting, to defray the costs of building the railroads, highways, bridges, plantations, and so forth that the French regime wished to build. Malagasy taxpayers were never asked whether they wanted these railroads, highways, bridges, and plantations, or allowed much input into where and how they were built. To the contrary: over the next half century, the French army and police slaughtered quite a number of Malagasy who objected too strongly to the arrangement (a hundred thousand, by some reports, during one revolt in 1947). It's not as if Madagascar has ever done any comparable damage to France. Despite this, from the beginning, the Malagasy people were told they owed France money, and to this day, the Malagasy people are still held to owe France money, and the rest of the world accepts the justice of this arrangement.[^176]

Outside of Madagascar, to this day France partially controls the currencies of several countries in central and western Africa, which were also former French colonies. Rather than maintain their own currencies, these countries use the "CFA franc" which used to be pegged to the French currency and is now pegged to the euro. As part of this arrangement, these countries must hold at least half of their foreign exchange reserves in France's custody, and France has considerable influence over their monetary policy, including reducing the currency peg at times. France charges fees for this service, including for printing the banknotes and for exchanging the CFA franc into and out of euros (since despite being pegged to the euro, the CFA franc is not accepted outside of these African countries, including in Europe). More darkly, most of these countries are deeply impoverished and have authoritarian rulers that are implicitly supported by France. Up-and-coming political challengers that have opposed this CFA franc system have tended to have short lifespans due to murders and coups, with France then supporting the pro-CFA franc leaders that gained power through violent means.[^177]

Similarly, in his previously mentioned book on the subject, Gladstein described in detail, with numerous citations, how the IMF and World Bank often reshape the economies of countries that they finance toward an export-driven economic model. Rather than develop into natural, diversified economies, various countries are structured in a top-down manner to serve wealthy nations with specific exports, such as shrimp from Bangladesh, copper from Zambia, and cotton from Togo. As Gladstein describes:

> World Bank loansÂ traditionallyÂ are project- or sector-specific, and have focused on facilitating the raw export of commodities (for example: financing the roads, tunnels, dams, and ports needed to get minerals out of the ground and into international markets) and on transforming traditional consumption agriculture into industrial agriculture or aquaculture so that countries could export more food and goods to the West.[^178]

A subtle result is that many developing countries are structured by these creditor organizations to produce and export cash-rich crops to wealthy developed countries that provide little or no caloric value (e.g., tea, coffee, cotton, and so forth), or to produce luxury foodstuffs that are too expensive for most of the local population to form as the basis of their diet (e.g., shrimp and cocoa). Meanwhile, these impoverished developing countries import basic grains, beans, oils, and other foodstuffs that form the foundation of their diet from the United States and other countries, rather than growing enough of these items themselves. Developing market economies are therefore optimized to maximize exports to get external currency, rather than be optimized to be as self-sufficient and balanced as possible. This means that when one of these developing countries runs into a balance of payments crisis, its own ability to feed its people becomes seriously imperiled, since it relies on dollar-denominated imports of those basic products despite having plenty of agricultural capacity to produce them domestically. When the U.S. dollar strengthens sharply, it often causes several developing countries to experience balance of payments crises at once, and to turn to the IMF for support for the dozenth time.[^179]

In other words, the modern financial structure results in neocolonialist value extraction in a similar (albeit less direct) way to how outright colonialism did. The method involves financial coercion instead of violent warfare. A research paper published in 2021 called "Plunder in the Post-Colonial Era: Quantifying Drain from the Global South Through Unequal Exchange, 1960--2018" concluded that rather than the wealthy global North giving aid to the impoverished global South for development, there has been a massive ongoing extraction of value from the global South to the global North. The abstract of the study was as follows:

> This paper quantifies drain from the global South through unequal exchange since 1960. According to our primary method, which relies on exchange-rate differentials, we find that in the most recent year of data the global North ('advanced economies') appropriated from the South commodities worth \$2.2 trillion in Northern prices --- enough to end extreme poverty 15 times over. Over the whole period, drain from the South totaled \$62 trillion (constant 2011 dollars), or \$152 trillion when accounting for lost growth. Appropriation through unequal exchange represents up to 7% of Northern GDP and 9% of Southern GDP. We also test several alternative methods, for comparison: we quantify unequal exchange in terms of wage differentials instead of exchange-rate differentials, and report drain in global average prices as well as Northern prices. Regardless of the method, we find that the intensity of exploitation and the scale of unequal exchange increased significantly during the structural adjustment period of the 1980s and 1990s. This study affirms that drain from the South remains a significant feature of the world economy in the post-colonial era; rich countries continue to rely on imperial forms of appropriation to sustain their high levels of income and consumption.[^180]

All 12 of the heads of the IMF since the institution's inception through to the present day have been European, and five of them have been French specifically, even though France only represents around 3% of global GDP. And yet the IMF disproportionally determines which countries receive emergency financing on a global scale, and under what terms.

The current global financial system with 160 different fiat currencies, each with a local monopoly over its jurisdiction, and each of which being tied to the highly salable U.S. fiat currency through dollar-denominated debts and dollar-denominated reserve holdings, tends to benefit those at the top of the socioeconomic ladder at the expense of those at the bottom. It helps keep people in developing countries in a state of constant development, dependency, and ever-rising debt, while structuring their economies around serving the wealthy developed countries rather than optimizing for self-sufficiency and well-roundedness. Currencies are regularly devalued (either due to mismanagement by their leaders or at the behest of the IMF) which keeps workers' wages and savings low in terms of global purchasing power. This process enriches corrupt developing country rulers who get to control their country's ledgers and siphon off value for themselves by devaluing the savings of the people. It enriches developed market corporations who get paid to do the work, and leaves the bill at the public level with the impoverished people of those nations who had little say in the process. It then helps keep those corrupt rulers in power by giving them bailouts and restructurings --- up to a dozen times or more --- to repeatedly push the problems into the future whenever they have a crisis in the present. Those crises are often caused by them having too much dollar-denominated debt in the first place, and the typical solution is to help them take on even more dollar-denominated debt and remain on that endless treadmill.
