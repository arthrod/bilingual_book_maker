# Chapter 6: **The Innovation of Double-Entry Bookkeeping**

In 1494, Luca Pacioli of Italy wrote *Summa de arithmetica*, which among other things included a detailed description of double-entry bookkeeping. This work led him to be known as the "Father of Accounting," since his work helped to revolutionize accounting and banking throughout Europe.[^94]

Double-entry bookkeeping splits a ledger into two parts, with those parts being able to reconcile with each other. If someone borrows 10 gold coins from a bank, for example, then those 10 gold coins become a liability for the borrower and an asset for the bank. Both the person and the bank have their half of the ledger that reconcile with each other, where someone's assets equal someone else's liabilities, and this allows for more complex financial systems to arise than were possible before the formulation of this technique. The bank can maintain a complicated set of assets and liabilities and can provide elaborate financial services.

Pacioli, however, didn't invent double-entry bookkeeping. The practice was in its early stages in parts of Italy before he published the work, and some of Pacioli's work was copied from fellow Italian Piero della Francesca. Prior to that, similar techniques were used by Islamic merchants (e.g., the hawala system), and brought to Italy via trade with them as described in the prior chapter. If we go back far enough, we can trace developments back to the Indian numeral system as important developments that eventually made double-entry bookkeeping more workable, and we can trace the earliest accounting back to Mesopotamia as described in this book's first chapter on ledgers. Pacioli's organization and publishing of these techniques became historically important and helped to spread and standardize the practice going forward from that point.

Importantly, these developments helped to improve payment systems in Venice, Florence, and other regions of modern-day Italy. Moneylenders in various forms had existed for thousands of years by this point, but these accountants in Italian city-states took the practice to a whole new level and gave rise to modern banking. The word "bank" is based on the Italian word *banco* which means "bench." Venice and Florence had rather free and open commerce compared to other regions in Europe at the time and traded significantly with Arab merchants. Accountants would sit on benches in the merchants squares and serve as bankers for the merchant class.[^95]

The development of banking made it so that merchants didn't have to bring large numbers of coins with them, and this development reduced friction and risk of trade. If two merchants both have an account open with one of the bankers, they could complete a trade by attesting to that banker to update the ledger. The banker merely changes the credits that he has for the two merchants, subtracting some from the buyer and adding some to the seller, minus a fee that he keeps for his services. To the extent that a merchant wants to settle with a banker by withdrawing or depositing physical gold, it can be done less frequently and therefore under more secure conditions. From there, bankers could combine this practice with banknotes, and become large institutions.

Paper financial instruments had already been devised in several regions. As described in the prior chapter, papyrus and paper-based bills of exchange were used as far back as Ancient Egypt and Ancient China and along the Silk Road. These early bills of exchange were generally linked to a specific person. For a simplistic example, I would have a paper receipt that says, "Lyn Alden is entitled to the payment of five ounces of gold from XYZ individual." Only me, or someone who can legally operate on my behalf, can use that paper to withdraw that gold from that specific individual.

Eventually, many of these papers became bearer assets in standardized amounts out of convenience. This meant that whoever the bearer of the paper is, can withdraw the gold.[^96] Again, in simplistic terms for the purpose of example, such a paper would say, "The bearer of this banknote is entitled to the withdrawal of five gold ounces from XYZ deposit institution." Merchants could use these papers in place of physical gold to trade with each other, in addition to maintaining their accounts with banks. Unlike the channel-based suftaja/hawala system, the acceptance of these bearer asset banknotes would be widespread as a general medium of exchange and would be linked to the reputation of a rather large financial institution.[^97]

In terms of payment technologies, we can summarize this shift from proto-banking to full-service banking in three primary steps, based around increasing levels of "negotiability." Negotiable, in financial jargon, means that a paper instrument can be transferred to a different party. In the first step, a simplistic non-negotiable paper instrument can only be redeemed for money by a specific party, as described in the original creation of the paper. In the second step, a paper instrument is made out to a specific party and is intended to be redeemed by them but is negotiable and therefore can be physically signed over to another party who can then redeem it instead. This involves a more complex and trusted financial network between a greater number of counterparties. In the third step, a paper instrument such as a banknote is inherently a bearer asset with nobody's name on it and can be freely exchanged between parties without any need to sign or otherwise transfer its ownership other than by physical possession. This third form requires and relies on large and widely recognized institutions.[^98]

The combination of bank accounts and banknotes, and the expansion of non-negotiable channel-based paper systems into widespread negotiable bearer-based paper systems, greatly enhanced the portability, liquidity, and effective divisibility of gold over time. Thanks to abstraction, the legal ownership of gold could now move much more frequently than the underlying physical gold.[^99] It increased the convenience and safety of dealing with large amounts of money, but also opened the possibility for counterparty risk and arbitrage. We can visualize the development of these networks almost like a paper version of the internet: Early channel-based connections eventually grew into an incredibly complex and interconnected set of entities that recognized and operated with each other. All of these paper assets represented claims for gold, but they required trust that the custodian of the gold would maintain it responsibly.[^100] In addition, silver coins were still useful at this time because this banking process had considerable overhead costs and was therefore not suitable for everyone to use --- particularly those in the bottom half of the wealth spectrum.

In many parts of medieval Europe, double-entry bookkeeping could also be maintained to some degree with tally sticks. If a creditor lent money to a borrower, they could record the details of the loan using a series of marks on a specialized wooden stick, and then break that stick in half lengthwise. The lender and the borrower would each keep their half of the stick so that they could fit the halves back together as proof that neither half was tampered with. Tallies were yet another form of ledger-keeping, and were tamper-resistant, but were physically inefficient from the lender's point of view since they had to maintain possession of many individual tally sticks.[^101]

**A Slide Toward Fractional Reserve Practices**

The most basic type of bank serves as a 100% asset-backed custodian. People deposit gold or another monetary asset, and the custodian bank issues paper claims against it; the bank doesn't do anything else with it other than keep it safe. Custodians generally charge fees for the services they provide.

Related examples today include holding physical gold in a vault, where you'll usually have to pay a recurring vaulting fee. The same is true for a safe deposit box. If you hold an exchange-traded fund filled with stocks, the fund charges an administrative fee. These are various types of full reserve custodial and administrative services. Rather than making money from lending out your assets (and thus risking the possibility that they won't get them back), they mostly just hold them and charge you a fee to cover their overhead and make a profit.

In a free market, bankers will naturally compete for market share by charging different levels of fees. And inevitably, bankers will realize that most of the gold never gets withdrawn at once, and instead it just sits there. Imagine, for example, a banker who realizes that in the past ten years of running a full reserve bank, the biggest aggregate withdrawal that he ever had by customers was 40% of the gold at once. He therefore decides that if he has at least 80% of the depositors' gold on hand, then he should be more than safe. He could put the other 20% of the gold to work by lending it out carefully for interest, earn some profits by doing so, and therefore offer a zero-fee service --- which will allow his bank to collect far more deposits. He has invented fractional reserve banking.

If he doesn't tell his customers what he is doing, then it is fraud, since they don't realize that 20% of their gold is being lent out and risked. If he tells them what he is doing and they agree to it, then it's a conscious trade-off. From the perspective of a potential depositor, maybe it seems quite reasonable for the banker to have 80% of the deposits on hand, and the other 20% in the form of illiquid loans to generate some extra income and eliminate fees for the depositor. And if indeed that is what consumers want as a trade-off, then more banks will be forced to fractionally reserve their deposits to eliminate fees as well, with some remaining as 100% reserve fee-based banks to serve the most risk-averse people who see the problems that this can lead to.

If most banks use this method, then there will be more claims for gold throughout the market than there is physical gold. Initially, the economy will likely boom from this expansion of credit, and therefore the region's rulers will like the practice, and probably encourage it.

However, banks can take this too far. If 80% reserves and zero-fee banking is an appealing combination, then how about 60% reserves and rather than merely eliminating fees, the bank gives depositors a small share of the lending profits in the form of interest on their deposits? Surely that will attract tons of deposits, and what are the odds that depositors in aggregate will try to withdraw more than 60% of their gold at once? Bankers in this system will tend to keep pushing the limit, resulting in less reserves as a percentage of deposits, so that depositors can be rewarded (knowingly or unknowingly) for taking on more and more custodial lending risk. There is an inherent aspect of instability in this type of design because it relies on the false promise that demand depositors can pull their funds out at any time, even though if most of them were to try at once, they wouldn't be able to.

It is important to note that an individual fractional reserve bank, assuming it is not insolvent from bad loans, still has at least as much assets as it does liabilities; it's just that not all the assets are in liquid form that are able to be withdrawn at once. The real problem is that in a financial system that consists of multiple fractional reserve banks, there are far more systemwide deposits than there is underlying gold. Money lent from one institution can be deposited at another institution and immediately (and fractionally) lent from there, resulting in the double-counting, triple-counting, quadruple counting, and so forth, of deposits relative to base money. At that point, people have far more claims for gold than the amount of gold that really exists in the system, and so in some sense, their wealth is illusory. This makes the system inherently unstable and prone to cascading bank runs, where any given bank run can easily lead to many other bank runs happening. A fractional reserve banking system is like a game of musical chairs; it functions for a while but if something ever stops the music, it can all fall apart quickly.

To make it worse, the incentives surrounding bank runs at fractional reserve banks are more problematic than they appear on the surface. Suppose that a bank makes loans as part of its asset mix, and some of those loans are defaulted on. The bank now only has 90% of deposits backed by gold or other assets, having lost the rest on defaulted loans. At first, this might not seem like too big of a problem; the depositors enjoyed years of low fees or even interest-sharing, and now they will take a 10% loss on their deposits due to bad risk management by the bank. Unfortunately, however, the situation won't be that benign if left to its own devices. As soon as some well-connected depositors get a hint that the bank is insolvent, they can pull their money out quickly. When others see that happen, they start to do it as well. If this goes unchecked, then eventually all the deposits will be pulled out, and the laggards who don't pull their deposits out will get nothing. It's not as though everyone takes a 10% loss on their deposits equally; those who pull out quickly can avoid any loss while those who try to pull out last can lose everything since there are no reserves left by that point. Therefore, the inherent incentives encourage bank runs at the earliest sign of insolvency by rewarding those who pull deposits out first. Due to repeated crises, authorities began deploying regulatory and insurance schemes to try to spread out the risk and disincentivize this type of depositor behavior.

These stability problems are more fundamentally solvable by strictly matching the durations of deposits and loans. In this type of system, "demand deposits" and banknotes can be withdrawn or redeemed at any time, and thus need to be fully backed by gold. Meanwhile, certificates of deposit lock up depositor funds for longer durations in the form of an investment contract or "time deposit" and can be used by the bank to make loans of the same duration or less. This method avoids making promises regarding liquidity to demand depositors that might not be able to be kept and prevents the excessive rehypothecation and duration mismatching that fractional reserve banking systems rely on. However, this method has not generally been what societies have turned to in practice. Bankers (along with their regulators and their clients) have instead historically turned to fractional reserve banking, meaning they just live with the underlying duration mismatch and "hope" that not too many demand depositors want their money back at once. The ubiquitous practice of fractional reserve banking has therefore been a large contributor to financial crises occurring so frequently and in every jurisdiction.

Modern banks typically have 5x-10x as much deposits as they have liquid cash reserves (500% or 1,000% leverage), with the rest of their assets consisting of various securities and loans. And most of the liquid cash reserves they do have aren't even in the form of physical cash; it's in abstract central bank reserves.[^102] It only takes a small fraction of people pulling their money out to cause a liquidity shortage. In contrast to a gold-backed banking system, in this modern reserve system a central bank can create more base money whenever needed, and thereby fix bank runs by diluting everyone's money.[^103]

Figure 6-A shows the historical ratio of U.S. commercial bank deposits to U.S. commercial bank cash. From the 1980s through 2008, the ratio climbed from around 6x to 23x, meaning at its peak there was only 1 dollar in bank cash for every 23 dollars in deposits, which is 2,300% leverage. Banks subsequently encountered the global financial crisis, and the U.S. Federal Reserve created a lot of new bank cash and used it to buy assets from the banks. The ratio of deposits to cash therefore dropped significantly and has been lower ever since, ranging from around 5x to around 6x (meaning the system is "only" 500% or 600% leveraged).

Figure 6-A[^104]

As of the end of 2022, banks in the United States had approximately \$18 trillion worth of deposits that they owed to customers, and only had a little over \$3 trillion worth of liquid bank cash.

That sounds (slightly) less scary when we consider that, at the end of 2022 banks had about \$22.6 trillion in total assets (of which \$3 trillion was liquid bank cash). Their other assets consist of things like mortgages, government bonds, and business loans. Overall, banks have more assets than they have liabilities, but most of the assets are loans and securities rather than cash on hand. The financial system cannot withstand a significant percentage of depositors pulling out their cash at once. If they were to try, they would be denied.[^105] In fact, at the end of 2022, U.S. banks had only around \$100 billion in actual physical cash on hand; the rest of their cash was in the form of intangible bank reserves listed as assets for them on the ledger of the central bank. During 2023, there were indeed some bank runs against banks that had mismanaged some of their assets during the Federal Reserve's rapid tightening of monetary policy, resulting in some of the largest bank failures in American history.

Part 4 of this book provides additional examples of fractional reserve lending and deposit creation within the context of a fiat currency banking system rather than a gold-backed banking system. For now, focusing on older gold-backed banking systems, we can ask the question, "Who controls the ledger"?

The answer is that each bank controls its own sub-ledger.[^106] When customers deposit funds at a bank, they are trusting that the banks are both ethical and competent, and either that they will fully retain the funds (in the case of full reserve custodian services) or if they do take risks, that they will do so prudently (in the case of fractional reserve banking).

In addition, we could say that the government partially controls the full ledger. There are not that many different banks in a country, and so government officials could easily go to each bank and order them to do something. Maybe they want to freeze or confiscate someone's deposits, for example. The bank would have to comply with this, whether the government is doing it for fair reasons or not. Maybe the government is persecuting someone for their religion, political affiliation, their sexual orientation, or for speaking inconvenient truths, which would be terrible. Or maybe the government is prosecuting someone for being a thief or con artist, and therefore is performing reasonable legal actions to administer justice. A government could also force all banks in its jurisdiction to hand over their gold to a central authority and give them paper IOUs for it, which is inevitably what happened to various countries over time. It's easier for a government to get the gold from a handful of banks than it would be to get it from each individual household.

Overall, it's the combination of the banks and the government that have power over the ledger that most people use as money in any banking system. For a gold-backed banking system, the only part of the ledger that individual users have control of is the precious metal coins that they retain in their own custody, and for that they rely on the properties of nature to maintain the integrity of the ledger. Once they surrender coins over to the banking system, they have begun to rely on a hierarchy of other people to control their money.
