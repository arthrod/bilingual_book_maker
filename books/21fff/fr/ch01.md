# Foreword

Fiction has long been a powerful tool for understanding the complexities of our current social paradigm and extrapolating where it might lead us in the future. By exploring the possibilities of tomorrow, we can gain valuable insights into the consequences of our actions today and hopefully chart a course towards a less violent and more prosperous future.

The stories collected in this volume offer a glimpse into a wide range of possible futures, each one a thought-provoking commentary on the world we live in today. From the dystopian landscape of 'Infinite Debt', where individuals are trapped in a never-ending cycle of debt and control, to the post-apocalyptic world of 'The Big Slash', where society has broken down and people must adapt to survive, these tales challenge us to think critically about the systems and structures that govern our lives.

Other stories, such as Proxy --- Temet Nosce and We Are Living Well, explore themes of identity, community, and resilience in the face of catastrophic change. They invite us to consider what it means to be ourselves in a world where technology is increasingly shaping our experiences and relationships. Meanwhile, 'Supplying the Slugs' offers a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and exploitation, highlighting the importance of responsibility and ethics in our interactions with others.

Yet, despite the challenges and dangers these stories portray, there is also a sense of hope and optimism that runs throughout this collection. For example, technologies like Bitcoin and Nostr are providing new opportunities for individuals to take control of their own lives and create more equitable systems. These freedom-enhancing technologies have the potential to decentralize power, promote transparency, and foster greater cooperation and collaboration.

As we look to the future, it is clear that our choices will have far-reaching consequences. The stories in this volume encourage us to think carefully about the kind of world we want to create and to work towards building a future that is more just, peaceful, and prosperous for all.
