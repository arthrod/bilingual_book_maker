## Bitcoin Is Venice

Allen Farrington and Sacha Meyers chart a crash course through the errors of modern economic theory and the world's broken fiat currency system with a hopeful destination: *Bitcoin Is Venice*.

What if a global, digital, sound, open-source, programmable currency was monetizing from absolute zero? What might economies look like under a Bitcoin standard that pushes beyond Hernando de Soto's abstraction of "capital" as "economic potential energy"? What might this new form of capital do to our current governing bodies? Can Bitcoin bring about a new global Renaissance? With Farrington and Meyers, the discussion is as revolutionary as the answers.

Thanks also to the BTC Media team for their tireless work bringing the manuscript to print. Thanks to George Bodine for the original painting used for the cover.

Thanks to Alex Gladstein at the Human Rights Foundation (HRF): Obviously for the important and inspiring work he and they do, but in our case, for arranging for the profit from sales of this book to go towards the HRF's Bitcoin Development Fund (BDF). In case the reader is unaware, the authors are not receiving compensation of any kind, either upfront or variably, based on sales. After the costs of the production and sale of this book, all proceeds will be donated.

In addition, the rights to the book are fully open-sourced. Not only do we allow piracy, we encourage it --- especially if in the form of providing translations. If anybody would like to translate the book into a language other than English, as just mentioned we cannot stop you, but we may be able to help you and possibly to pay you. If this is of interest, please contact the authors for more information.

In the likely event that the reader did not personally pay for a physical copy of this book, in whatever form this text has taken as they find themselves reading it, and, in doing so, make a small donation already, we would encourage them to consider donating to the HRF, either the BDF or the general fund, as feels most appropriate.

Over and above those who helped with the process of writing, editing, publishing, and more, we would like to extend special thanks to Robert Natzler, Saifedean Ammous, Elizabeth Stark, and, of course, the global ecosystem of volunteers promoting this civilizational project.

Rob has been thanked above for contributions to this manuscript but has also been kindly and diligently editing all our writing for many years longer than we have been publishing, blogging, or attempting to be public figures of any kind. In a perfect world, he would have been a third co-author, but as we know well, the world is far from perfect. We can only hope that, post-hyperbitcoinization, his time preference will have lowered to the point he can be bothered putting pen to paper himself. Until such a glorious moment, it would be unfair not to acknowledge that an enormous amount of the intellectual content in this book originated in conversation with Rob. The few ideas that are original are probably originally his. Thank you, Rob.

Saifedean has also been thanked above as having generously lent his time to the writing and editing process, but he is owed an additional thanks far, far more important than this alone. Dr. Ammous taught us not just by his thinking but --- as the best teachers do --- by his example, to stop worrying about how others will receive our ideas, put them out there, and see what happens. Or, as Mrs. Ammous previously encouraged him, "Stop Talebing and do it!" (So, we suppose, thank you, Mrs. Ammous as well!) We acted on this inspiration long before committing to write this book, to be clear. But this book is the intellectually indebted, years-later output of the precedent set by his. Thank you, Saif.

Elizabeth is of a different stripe to Rob and Saif, and to us. She is likely of a different stripe to anybody else in the world, as a matter of fact. She is a force of nature. Her profession and skillset are entirely different to our own and her impact on the manuscript has been minimal. But her impact on our thinking and --- sincerely and without exaggeration --- our attitude to our work and to life has been profound. Her seemingly unbounded energy and enthusiasm helped us to keep going through dark times --- for us, for Bitcoin, and as it sometimes seemed, for the world.

Her unwavering commitment to just doing good forces a continual reckoning with respect to our own motivations, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We believe in turn that she has coined the most important meme in Bitcoin history, or at least the most ethical, the most encouraging, and the most emblematic of the good we are all trying to do: number of people go up. And what better and more concise way to describe what we hope for from this book? It is very much helpful that our profession and skillsets are different because it means that, while her work will change the lives of billions, perhaps ours can reach the marginal thousand or so. Thank you, Elizabeth.

Finally, we thank all those who have contributed to Bitcoin voluntarily and at their own expense: developers, reviewers, writers, educators --- everybody. The authors are in a position to promote human freedom and prosperity in a manner that aligns perfectly with our jobs. This is an incredible privilege and we do not take it at all lightly. We know most are not so lucky. Others have contributed more than we will ever be able to, at greater risk, and for less or no reward. If we have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. Whatever success we have is due to them and should be theirs.

To whatever extent we can make this true by proclaiming it: Our success is their success.

Thank you, all, and we hope we have made you proud. Enjoy. ☺

## A Note on the Composition of the Text

This book came about in an unusual way. Never conceived of as a single project, the content is fairly described as the intellectual preoccupation of the authors for the last four or five years, both personally and professionally. The idea to write in this medium at all came after the unexpected success first of This Is Not Capitalism, an essay cowritten by Sacha and Allen in March 2020, and which forms the basis of Chapter Three of the same name. Second, the essay trilogy Wittgenstein's Money, The Capital Strip Mine, and Bitcoin Is Venice, written by Allen from around June 2020 onwards and published between December 2020 and February 2021. This trilogy, likewise, forms the basis of Chapters Four through Six and were edited by Sacha and influenced by his ideas.

The book remains more a collection of related essays than a unified whole, and we use the word "chapter" more for ease of reference than absolute accuracy. In this light, it is fair to highlight that, as was just described for Chapters Three through Six, in the now complete collection, Chapters One and Eight (Wrestling with the Truth and These Were Capitalists) were written by Sacha and edited by Allen, while Chapters Two, Seven, and Nine (The Complex Markets Hypothesis, A Capital Renaissance, and Global Money, Local Freedom) were written by Allen and edited by Sacha. We have thoroughly enjoyed this process and firmly believe it has improved both of our writing and, indeed, our thinking. Although we use "we" throughout, this is more as an aid to the reader than a reflection of any authorial unity. The result is less a true synthesis and more a collection of essays from our individual points of view. We like that each author's voice retained its originality, even if it meant including material on which we disagree.

# Foreword

What if the year was 1400, and you stood at the brink of the Renaissance but didn't know it?

What if someone handed you a magical book that would explain what the coming Renaissance was, reveal the injustices and inefficiencies of the medieval system, and foretell why and how things would change in the coming decades?

What you have in your hands, dear reader, is a book that will do just this for you today, as we approach the Bitcoin Renaissance.

Humanity has potentially begun a historical transformation on par with the agricultural and industrial revolutions, and one with potentially even greater impact.

That may sound outlandish, but this book makes a compelling argument that it is, in fact, true.

In the same way that medieval Venice set the stage for the peoples of Europe to break free of the empire and transition from serfdom to liberty, and from financial slavery to financial sovereignty, today the Bitcoin network is the path to escaping the broken and unsustainable post-1971 political economy.

In newspapers and on television we are told not to worry about inflation, that employment is more important than saving, and that we can own nothing and be happy.

We should be satisfied, in other words, to work for those who own the assets, just as we watch their wealth continue to grow and concentrate, while we see the currency that we earn depreciate and see our way out of debt vanish.

This book is a stunning rejection of this emerging neo-feudalism and its administrators.

Over the past decade, governments, economists, and journalists have relentlessly hammered into the minds of their populations and audiences that Bitcoin is dangerous and risky. That it's for criminals. That it's a Ponzi scheme. That it's destroying the planet.

Time, however, has shown that it has been dangerous and risky to not hold bitcoin, which has been, since inception, the best-performing financial asset in the world.

But against the facts, Bitcoin users are still routinely told by authorities that their choice --- opting peacefully into a new, fair, and neutral monetary system --- is wrong, immoral, or even treasonous.

The reality, as the authors of this book argue, is that the world financial system is a cruel labyrinth, and we're all trapped inside, stuck in a situation where tomorrow is traded for today, where capital is strip-mined without consideration for the future, where our money is devalued by central planners, where our liberties are increasingly eroded, and where our behavior is spied on and used to engineer us to become more compliant and dependent.

Bitcoin fixes this and helps us escape but not by violence. It is "not a sword for Theseus to fight the Minotaur, but a thread to follow to exit the Labyrinth."

And exit we shall. We, after all, owe the Minotaur nothing. Let the beast starve. We'll find our own way out.

The way is through a new kind of Venice in cyberspace available to anyone in the world regardless of one's wealth, class, race, religion, gender, nationality, or occupation.

Where any of the billions with internet access can connect to this revolution, be a part of it, and even own a piece of it. That's what makes this revolution so much different from the ones that came before. Whereas those achieved change through new hierarchical structures, Bitcoin will change the world through decentralization.

As more and more people begin to realize that Bitcoin is monetizing right in front of our eyes, creating an alternative to the degenerate, fiat capitalist system that we have been forced to partake in, we should feel no debt to the old regime of short-term thinking, top-down planning, consumption-driven spending, growth obsession, central banking, bailouts, rent-seeking, regulatory capture, toxic bigness, risk transfer, globalism, and financialization.

Instead, we should turn our eyes to a future of long-term thinking, peer-to-peer collaboration, open-source architecture, nurturing, replenishing, risk sharing, localism, and growing productive capital, where the farmer plants his seeds instead of eating them and enjoys many harvests to come.

To understand what's coming, we need a guide. There could scarcely be one better than the book in your hands.

From the stunning realizations one receives when reading Chapter 3, This is Not Capitalism, to the illumination provided by Chapter 5, The Capital Strip Mine, the authors accomplish something extraordinary in the chapters ahead.

These lucid and lively pages explore all the nooks and crannies of the impact Bitcoin will leave on the world, especially in regard to investing, communications, culture, energy use, environmental sustainability, and how we build our communities.

In the book's crescendo, Chapter 6, Bitcoin Is Venice, we get a clarion call for a better future: more inclusive, less exploitative, filled with choice and reason and compassion. A financial system unrigged, with we, the people, at the controls. Digital gold, digital cash, and real property rights for all.

Perhaps you found it surprising that a human rights advocate be asked to write the foreword to a book about finance and economics. But read the book, and you'll understand why I've been tasked with preparing you for this journey.

This isn't simply about how money and finance works --- though you'll learn a lot about that along the way --- it's a book about how we can, and how we must, harness the power of Bitcoin to secure liberty in the electronic age.

Already as you read this there are tens of millions of people around the world who are peacefully opting into Bitcoin. Not just in dictatorships and broken economies, where 4.3 billion languish under authoritarians and 1.6 billion suffer under double- or triple-digit inflation, but in the West, too. Even the most hardened skeptics are admitting that yes, Bitcoin has a use case, somewhere.

But why? Why do, every day, more and more people exit the existing financial system into something new? This book explains the why: Individuals are leaving the old system of degenerate fiat capitalism, as the authors call it, as their money isn't theirs, it's someone else's, and the real owners are abusing the money printer.

This book is a guide to the system-wide effects of what happens when the money printer keeps going, when a preposterous global debt-to-capital ratio steals value from future generations, and when value is stealthily transferred from the have-nots to the haves.

But it's also, more importantly, an inspiring vision of a better money laying the foundation for a brighter future. As crazy as it may sound, the authors will explain why this is not just a dream and is something that can, and likely will --- as the result of a beautiful incentive structure --- be achieved. Most of the world just doesn't know it yet.

I feel comfortable saying that this book will be vastly more appreciated in five years, ten years, and twenty years, then today.

It will age very well.

Everyone else will get to appreciate it in due time. Today, you get a sneak peek of the future.

Enjoy the ride.

# Introduction

Quentin Skinner's monumental overview of the development of early modern political philosophy, *The Foundations of Modern Political Thought*, begins with the following lines:

As early as the middle of the twelfth century the German historian Otto of Freising recognised that a new and remarkable form of social and political organisation had arisen in Northern Italy. One peculiarity he noted was that Italian society had apparently ceased to be feudal in character.

While Skinner's concern is political philosophy and not economic history, it is easy enough to identify that these social changes were made possible by a nascent form of capitalism. As the great medievalist Henri Pirenne commented on the period and region in his *Medieval Cities*:

Lombardy, where from Venice on the east and Pisa and Genoa on the west all the commercial movements of the Mediterranean flowed and were blended into one, flourished with an extraordinary exuberance. On the wonderful plain cities bloomed with the same vigor as the harvests. The fertility of the soil made possible for them an unlimited expansion, and at the same time the ease of obtaining markets favoured both the importation of raw materials and the exportation of manufactured products. There, commerce gave rise to industry, and as it developed, Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Verona, and all the old towns, all the old Roman municipia, took on new life, far more vigorous than that which had animated them in antiquity.

Pirenne added that the rise of these cities, which was predicated on commercial and industrial expansion,

Strongly stimulated social progress. It made no less a contribution in spreading throughout the world a new conception of labor. Before this it had been serf; now it became free, and the consequences of this fact, to which we shall return, were incalculable. Let it be added, finally, that the economic revival of which the twelfth century saw the flowering revealed the power of capital, and enough will have been said to show that possibly no period in all history had a more profound effect upon humanity.

And wouldn't you know it, but feudalism seems to be making a comeback. Joel Kotkin introduces his pithy tract, *The Coming of Neo-Feudalism*, anticipating this re-emergence:

Of course it will look different this time around: we won't see knights in shining armor, or vassals doing homage to their lords, or a powerful Catholic Church enforcing the reigning orthodoxy. What we are seeing is a new form of aristocracy developing in the United States and beyond, as wealth in our postindustrial economy tends to be ever more concentrated in fewer hands. Societies are becoming more stratified, with decreasing chances of upward mobility for most of the population. A class of thought leaders and opinion makers, which I call the "clerisy," provide intellectual support for the emerging hierarchy. As avenues for upward mobility are diminishing, the model of liberal capitalism is losing appeal around the globe, and new doctrines are arising in its place, including ones that lend support to a kind of neo-feudalism.

Kotkin is more concerned with effects than with causes. His worry is, in essence, that the social fabric is rapidly unraveling. His argumentation repeatedly alludes to Shoshana Zuboff's notion of surveillance capitalism. While we agree with Kotkin (and by extension with Zuboff, and to really give credit where it is due, with Michael Goldstein) that it is important to give mimetically effective names to phenomena about which we intend to have productive discussions, we feel that the monolithic technology platforms this moniker is intended to capture are not the cause of neo-feudalism but are simply another awful effect of something deeper.

It is our belief that not all, but certainly some --- and probably most --- of the afflictions Kotkin cites can most sensibly be attributed to the regime of political economy dominant in the West since 1971, particularly acute since 2009, the roots of which can be traced to 1913 at the very earliest. Often lazily referred to as "capitalism," or sometimes sardonically as "post-capitalism," we think this is, in fact, another case of a poorly chosen name leading to a poorly framed discussion. If anything, the distinguishing feature of the economic circumstances from which these afflictions arise is the normalized devaluation and consumption of capital in the pursuit of ever more leveraged "growth." We will sometimes refer to the dominant regime of political economy but sometimes as degenerate fiat "capitalism" instead.

Those who do not own hard assets are increasingly tending to drown in debt from which they will realistically never escape, unable to save except by speculation, and unable to afford the inflation in the essential costs of living that does not officially exist. What amounts to an "official" message is the likes of Christine Lagarde (then-president of the International Monetary Fund and now of the European Central Bank) musing that "we should be happier to have a job than to have our savings protected," and the World Economic Forum suggesting that, by 2030, "you will own nothing, but you will be happy." [^1] You will use things that somebody owns, mind you. But that somebody will not be you.

If we were to believe that these people mean what they say, and that the consumption of capital is not going to stop --- perhaps we even realize that it cannot stop --- we might be as similarly inclined as Otto of Freising to look for any sprouts of civilization that manage to advance beyond our rebooted feudalism. There may end up being a variety of reasons that different social units avoid this state. We think that, for some, the reason will be Bitcoin.

We think for some, but we hope for many, and we pray for all.

***

Bitcoin has gone through many cycles of popular conception, usually with high correlation with its cycles in price. From a wacky open-source project only known to a handful of mailing list participants and only understood by those proficient in C++ and steeped in cryptography, political philosophy, and monetary history, Bitcoin has since been dubbed just about every metaphor under the sun. It has also been written off more times than can easily be counted. The website 99bitcoins.com has a dedicated page for Bitcoin Obituaries which, as of the time of writing, lists 428 occasions on which a relatively mainstream media outlet declared Bitcoin "dead." And yet, as of the time of writing, its price in dollars is near its all-time high. Although impossible to quantify, we feel its reputation, its strength, and its potential are at all-time highs as well.

Most serious attempts by outsiders to grapple with Bitcoin over the years, even those unabashedly positive, have tended to view the phenomenon too narrowly in our estimation. And to be fair, often the authors will admit as much. We think Bitcoin is more than a cheaper payment rail or "digital gold," for example. It is more than a "digital ledger" and it is more than a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem. It is certainly more than the "underlying technology" of "the blockchain," the primary value of which has turned out to be crystallized in consulting contracts to hapless conglomerates and the terrible books the savviest of these consultants would go on to write.

Of course, this is not an original insight. In recent years, it has become more generally accepted that Bitcoin is an inherently interdisciplinary phenomenon. To view Bitcoin solely through the lens of economics, say, or cryptography is to miss the forest for the trees. Bitcoin lies at the intersection of, at the very least, these two, as well as financial theory, history, political philosophy, theoretical computer science, distributed systems theory, game theory, and network and protocol design. Possibly even more that have escaped our own understanding. Arguably, the inside view is to work from the premise that it cannot be grappled with in its entirety but that perhaps some expertise can be brought to bear on some corner of its workings, necessarily constituting, at best, a humble contribution to a patchwork of thought. As Jameson Lopp famously put it, and which certainly set our minds at ease, "Nobody understands Bitcoin, and that's OK."

We do not claim to "understand Bitcoin", nor do we claim to have stumbled into the perfectly comprehensive and expansive framing. In fact, our framing is still fairly narrow in the scheme of things. We will barely mention the more technical topics of cryptography, theoretical computer science, distributed systems theory, game theory, or network and protocol design. There are many fine works on these topics we would recommend to the interested reader well ahead of any of our own thoughts.

But within the narrower confines of financial theory, economics, history, and political philosophy, we feel much more confident. We believe the popular understanding of Bitcoin can and should extend to these fields. We can only hope our contribution in these areas of our limited and relative expertise will be valuable.

***

When we say that the reason some social units can avoid collapse into neo-feudalism by embracing Bitcoin, what does that mean?

We are sure it seems hyperbolic to most, if not outright ludicrous, but it's actually fairly prosaic. It means that those social units that voluntarily choose to embrace Bitcoin --- a global, digital, sound, open-source, programmable money --- will be in a position to accumulate long-term--oriented capital at a disproportionate rate to those who do not. They will have a superior economic foundation from which to build healthy social and political institutions, which will contrast to those left behind as medieval Venice did to the remnants of the Western Empire.

This is the thesis of the book in a nutshell.

***

In Chapter One, Wrestling with the Truth, we provide a gentle introduction to the thesis of the book and the concepts with which we intend to grapple throughout via the allegory of mixed martial arts (MMA).

We argue that the philosophical essence of "competition" in economics and broader social affairs is a clash of alternative hypotheses as to what is really true. It is experimental but not scientific; combative but not violent; traditional but not frozen in time. We believe MMA demonstrates that the search for truth is unpredictable, dynamic, and accumulative of hard-earned knowledge. It is an essentially human endeavor that cannot be "modeled" with any intellectual honesty or seriousness. But it can be understood, and, as a metaphor, it can be usefully recycled.

In Chapter Two, The Complex Markets Hypothesis, we argue that academic economics has become overly mathematised and enamored with finance. First, this is in part due to the overwhelming mass of data financial markets throw off on which scientistic statistical analysis can be performed. Second, it's in part due to political interference in economic activity primarily and most destructively being directed through financial markets, creating an attractor for corruption --- political and intellectual alike.

As professional investors, we think we are well placed to diagnose the shibboleths of modern finance as pseudoscientific obscurantism. Its tenets are designed to confuse outsiders and avoid and escape criticism for siphoning wealth and power to the already wealthy and powerful at the expense of the rest of society. Middle-class savers are hardest and most obviously hit, but everybody suffers in one way or another. We argue that the cornerstone of modern finance theory, the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), is self-serving, vacuous nonsense.

Following Chapter One, Wrestling with the Truth, we build on our conceptual toolkit of unpredictability, dynamism, and accumulation of hard-earned knowledge to provide in place of the EMH a common-sense analysis of the workings of financial markets. These concepts will in turn serve us well in our analysis of economics in the chapters that follow.

# In Chapter Three, This Is Not Capitalism

In Chapter Three, This Is Not Capitalism, we switch our attention from the modern theory of financial markets to the modern practice. We diagnose the regime of political economy dominant in the West since 1971, and particularly acute since 2009, and alluded to earlier in this introduction. This regime is often called "capitalism," or, if acknowledged to have diverged a great deal from what "capitalism" once meant, is still felt to be somehow the inevitable end point of the dynamics of political economy that capitalism requires and creates.

We think this is deeply misleading. If "capitalism" means anything, it ought to at least include "the preservation and growth in the capital stock." We argue that the modern malaise and perpetual economic crises often attributed to "capitalism" follow from the implicit rejection of the ethos of nurturing, replenishing, and growing capital that is instilled by central banking, regulatory capture, and financialization.

Although we do not yet mention Bitcoin, we feel this is the political and economic background that made Bitcoin necessary in the first place. In fact, the acceleration of this regime in 2009 is precisely when and why Bitcoin was conceived and gifted to the world. Understanding the logic and dynamics of the regime is an essential starting point for grasping the emergence of a global, digital, sound, open-source, programmable money.

# In Chapter Four, Wittgenstein's Money

In Chapter Four, Wittgenstein's Money, we ponder that this emergence, while clearly instigated by central banking and financialization, and while of civilizational importance, has been largely ignored on the understandable yet comical grounds that it just doesn't seem like such a thing could ever happen.

We, therefore, ask an important question: What would it seem like if it did seem like a global, digital, sound, open-source, programmable money was monetizing from absolute zero? We find the mainstream economic understanding of the phenomenon rejects its importance by way of rejecting its existence on essentially semantic grounds: It isn't happening because it can't happen. It is not the kind of thing that happens.

We instead develop an analysis of money that is appropriately unpredictable, dynamic, and accumulative of hard-earned knowledge, as to capture that such a thing can happen and to give some idea of what it would seem like if it were happening.

# In Chapter Five, The Capital Strip Mine

In Chapter Five, The Capital Strip Mine, we consider the likely effects on the capital stock of a regime of political economy systematically ignoring the analysis of money just provided in Chapter Four, Wittgenstein's Money.

We establish that the primary purpose, utility, and benefit of money is to manage economic uncertainty, and that this assurance paves the way for the deliberate generation and embrace of yet more uncertainty brought about by directing time and energy towards the creation of capital. We argue that imposing an overly static view of money sets up a vicious cycle in which we are unwittingly incentivized to consume capital rather than create it, which destroys the benefits of money and disincentivizes capital formation further.

We predict such a system would evolve towards ever greater immediate consumption under ever more debt, and that if, by some unimaginable historical tragedy, money itself were to come to exist exclusively in the form of debt receipts, this vicious cycle could likely never be escaped.

# In Chapter Six, Bitcoin Is Venice

In Chapter Six, Bitcoin Is Venice, we paint a far more optimistic picture of the future given Bitcoin is not a debt receipt: It is a pure asset with clear monetary utility. Moreover, it is historically unprecedented as a technology that offers virtually no potential utility towards violent ends whatsoever, and yet high defensibility against violence. These form an intellectual foundation for a radical reimagining of the monetary weave of the social fabric.

We predict, among a range of possibilities discussed in the chapter, more mobile capital than has ever existed, an associated shift in the geopolitics of citizenship, labor, and capital, a preeminent place for a close and novel variant of Islamic finance, and the collapse of most financial assets of the Ancien Régime into Bitcoin's growing gravitational pull.

# In Chapter Seven, A Capital Renaissance

In Chapter Seven, A Capital Renaissance, we turn our attention to the ways in which we predict a Bitcoin standard will enable a return to, and a normalization of, the nurturing, replenishment, and growth of capital. We will focus on highly tangible sources of capital — those where the effects of Bitcoin can be reasonably predicted in the not-too-distant future. We explore the likely effect of a return to sound money on the financial industry, internet infrastructure, and the environment.

# In Chapter Eight, These Were Capitalists

In Chapter Eight, These Were Capitalists, we push further Hernando de Soto's brilliant abstraction of "capital" as not mere money — as originally introduced and explored across Chapter Four, Wittgenstein's Money and Chapter Five, The Capital Strip Mine — but rather "economic potential energy."

We believe that nurturing, replenishing, and growing a stock of capital is a practice that is fundamental to all human affairs, not just economic exchange. Economic activity performed suitably creatively and responsibly — such as that described in Chapter Seven, A Capital Renaissance — may well be only a special case of a more general principle of social organization and behavior. It is a manifestation of a healthy society: the gauge of its health as observable with respect to its management and utilization of scarce resources and specialization of craft and output, among many other possible gauges.

We aim to make this plain by seeking to learn from those who fought to accumulate highly intangible sources of "capital" across three far more intangible stocks of capital than those previously discussed: the social fabric, the built environment, and cultural expression.

# In Chapter Nine, Global Money, Local Freedom

In Chapter Nine, Global Money, Local Freedom, we shift the topic of discussion away from, implicitly, voluntary cooperation across economic and cultural exchange.

We focus instead on the governing bodies that have nominal authority over this behavior and ask, very simply, what becomes of them under a Bitcoin standard? We think it is undeniable that sovereign corporations will simply have to adapt in terms of their constitution and functioning if they do not want to collapse into insolvency, both financial and societal.

We frame our discussion around the concept of returns to violence and aim to explore from first principles how the shifting returns to violence under a Bitcoin standard will change the role of the state, and, surely in turn, the opportunities for individuals to voluntarily cooperate.

***

Our various predictions for Bitcoin's path from this point on — for the optionality it offers to those social units that embrace it — could be true at any and every scale. It could be an individual, a family, a friend group, a neighborhood, a company, a city, an industry, a country, or the entire world. We will have to wait and see.

Of course, it could be nobody. It could fail altogether. We say this primarily to guard against accusations of blind faith, speculative mania, and fundamental unseriousness. But we don't say it to feign intellectual sophistication with post-hoc, unfalsifiable fence-sitting.

As if this wasn't entirely clear already, we are very happy indeed to be on the record as saying it is more likely Bitcoin will succeed than not. And so, while there are good reasons it might fail, "it's dumb" and "I don't like it" are not among them. In order to sensibly articulate the reasons why it might fail, you have to have at least tried to understand it in the first place.

Of course, nobody fully understands Bitcoin, and that's OK. But we can all put in the work to understanding it more, and we hope this book will help those who want to try.

# Chapter One

## Wrestling with the Truth

Discovery and knowledge as aesthetic, codified, and practical

Let us begin with a thought experiment: Bitcoin's history mirrors the history of mixed martial arts (MMA).

Consider that prices emerge from action, and the truth of prices comes from experimentation. It is not dictated. It is discovered iteratively. Every transaction spreads knowledge, inching a price towards a better consensus, yet consensus itself is a moving target.

MMA has gone through many iterations from its roots in arts like judo to the form we know today, and it continues to undergo this process through the natural experiment every individual fight represents.

The power of prices is the process of dynamic discovery that underpins their emergence, not the fleeting consensus of a specific moment in time. The price is never right, but prices are as right as can be hoped for at that moment. Attempts to coerce prices without the ability to change the reality they communicate are, therefore, bound to run into trouble. And yet we do not seem capable to accept the truth of prices whenever it is inconvenient. To ensure that consensus can arrive at valid social truths, we require systems or institutions that withstand attempts at coercion and which tap into decentralized discovery.

Martial arts are a fitting case study, and an encouraging allegory for all that follows. A few decades ago, they were under the grip of bullshitting coercion. Today, they are thriving under a marketplace of ideas.

### In the Beginning Was the Fight

> "It's kind of crazy when you think about the history of martial arts. [...] Since the dawn of time, people have been trying to figure out better ways to fuck people up. Since they figured out language and figured out how to teach skills they've been working on techniques. [And not] until 1993 did we really know what worked."

Wrestling is probably the oldest sport in the world. The earliest evidence for it dates from cave paintings in France over 15,000 years old. We also discovered that most holds practiced today were known in ancient times. Boxing is a little younger, depicted as far back as the third millennium BC in Sumerian relief. The reader might therefore be forgiven for believing there is little more to learn about the art of fighting. And yet, the modern world has only learned which fighting techniques are truly effective in the last thirty years. Few sports have evolved as much in recent decades, fewer still tracing their lineage to prehistory.

As Joe Rogan alludes to above, 1993 marks the birth of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. UFC spawned a free marketplace of fighting ideas called Mixed Martial Arts, or MMA. Before, charm and authority shielded much of martial arts from scrutiny. Competition was limited and the truth of stylistic superiority could not be definitively established. The UFC along with its famed fighting arena, the Octagon, created an environment where competing hypotheses could be systematically tested. With nowhere for falsehoods to hide, truth might finally stand a fighting chance.

The recent evolution of martial arts serves as a unique case study to understand the ways in which ideas are created, tested, and spread. Instead of arguing about a hypothetical judo versus karate fight with your mates after one too many pints, the UFC would run the experiment for all to observe. Instead of judging a given martial art by how cool it looked in a movie, it would have to prove its efficacy against a skilled, motivated, and resisting opponent. Deference to a sensei would no longer suffice. Mere decree would hold no value. Traditions would be questioned and schools humiliated. Others would emerge from unsuspected corners of the world. In that sense, we can say after 1993 fighting stopped being theoretical. It became practical.

We will evaluate the evolution of fighting using three settings: the Movie Set, the Dojo, and the Octagon. We will loosely link each with the three ancient Greek modes of persuasion: Pathos or emotion, Ethos or authority, and Logos or reason, and three different ways of learning: inspiration, rote, and praxis. We will see how ineffective ideas were spread and what would eventually combat them: ideally a front kick to the face. This is the story of how the UFC unleashed the competitive forces of free markets onto martial arts. It is, by extension, an allegory for the power of competition in incentivizing the search for and discovery of truth.

### The Movie Set, or the Appeal to Emotions and Aesthetic Knowledge

> "It is impossible for somebody to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction."  
> 
> ---  Harry Frankfurt, On Bullshit

Starting in the 1960s, Hollywood was largely responsible for the spread of Eastern martial arts to a Western audience. Many of today's greatest martial artists were drawn in by movies such as Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon or Jean-Claude Van Damme's Bloodsport. The romantic image of a skilled fighter swiftly disposing of a dozen goons on his way to glory is more than enough to make most kids search for their nearest Kung Fu club.

Unfortunately, for many, their unrealistic expectations were rewarded only with bullshit. Hollywood looks to sell movie tickets, not rigorously test fighting techniques in realistic combat scenarios. Movies spread ideas and techniques of martial arts to resonate visually and emotionally with their audience and generate box office revenues.

Ancient Greeks dubbed this method for convincing people Pathos, an appeal to emotion. You believe me because you like me. What you learn you know (or you think you know) because of how it makes you feel; it feels right. It is a distinctly aesthetic way to acquire knowledge. It is pleasing. It is calming. Its forms are smooth, symmetrical, and flush.

Knowledge arrived at by this form of inspiration can of course be legitimate, but we can only know this by providing a proof. If practical, as opposed to deductive, a proof requires a test. But perhaps these fighting methods are never supposed to be tested, only admired. In fact, the point in these circumstances is precisely to avoid such a test at all costs. It is the feeling of knowledge that must be preserved; not the fact of it, or likely lack thereof.

No matter how good these movies are — and some are bloody good — they put form over function. A punch no longer travels the shortest distance to its target. It takes a dramatic looping detour. Street fights rarely end up on the ground. They are perfectly choreographed across streetscapes. The street ceases to be an interactive terrain of combat and becomes instead the inert setting of a melodramatic dance. If not the dance, then certainly the drama is compelling enough for the audience to suspend its disbelief, which is when the virus strikes. We buy some of the extravaganza because of how pretty it looks and we emotionally bond with the hero. Yet long after the credits have rolled and the lights turned back on, moviegoers will still associate karate with near superhuman feats. Most know it's all exaggerated, but we probably will still believe a black belt is someone to fear.

In moderation, a serious martial arts school might resort to breaking boards to attract new members, a useless practice never taught in a self-respecting regimen. Taken to the extreme, we get fake martial arts that teach you to channel life energy or chi into your strikes.

This is total fantasy. The emitters and receivers of these ideas alike are ambivalent as to their real effectiveness. Their assessment is based solely on how it looks and makes them feel. This is as divorced from empirical testing as it gets. The dynamics are like those of cult members accepting indoctrination purely for the sense of belonging it can bring.

### The Dojo, or the Appeal to Authority and Codified Knowledge

> "Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught."  
> 
> ---  Oscar Wilde

You must bow before entering the dojo. It's tradition. It's respect. It's Japanese. It is a show of deference to authority signaling a willingness to learn from the master. Unlike in fake martial arts, students of real martial arts believe in their teacher and her craft because of her accomplishments and standing in the wider community. This is akin to the trust we put in police officers and government officials. We might not be able to directly assess the veracity and deservedness of their claim, but it stands to reason that many others have done so. Ideas are tested for effectiveness through an intermediary.

The dojo spreads ideas by appealing to authority, or Ethos. The knowledge we derive we learn by rote. As a child might memorize her times tables by performing a kind of mental operation, so too she learns her karate steps by repetition of a physical operation. The knowledge has been codified and transmitted.

One of the greatest such teachers — or sensei — is Kano Jigoro, born in 1860, eight years before the Meiji Restoration when Japan began to industrialize. This period also marks the abolition of the samurai warrior class. Its three main disciplines were: sword fighting — or kenjutsu — archery — or kyujutsu — and unarmed combat — or jujitsu. As the samurai class began to fade, so did its knowledge. Enters Jigoro. While not a samurai, Jigoro trained in martial arts and became well known for his meticulous recording of the jujutsu techniques he deemed most effective. He described his work as "keeping what I felt should be kept, and discarding what I felt should be discarded." Old masters sought Jigoro to share their techniques in the hope they would not die out. These masters accumulated hard-won stores of capital in the form of knowledge gained through experimentation. Unable to maintain, let alone nurture, replenish, and grow these stocks themselves, the masters looked for someone they hoped would. They feared their knowledge would depreciate entirely, leaving nothing behind. Jigoro offered the means to avert such an epistemological disaster. He called his new school judo, the gentle way.

Given the task at hand and the high quality of the result, Jigoro seems to have achieved wonders. Judo remains one of the more effective martial arts and is a great foundation for aspiring fighters. But its flaws were inherent in Jigoro's method. By choosing what to keep or discard, he acted as the authority. We might say his doctrine acted as a server, and all who followed were merely clients. Of course, as a single server with no exposure to feedback, the doctrine itself invited self-induced vulnerability. The rigid structure Jigoro created shielded judo from outside criticism and internal experimentation alike. Students defer to their sensei and dojo rules prohibit using techniques from another tradition.

What if I punched you before you got close enough to grab my collar and throw me to the floor? It's not allowed. You may only compete against other practitioners of your art. As a result, the art slowly loses any grasp of the reality of consequential combat and turns into a game played against itself. Don't strike, don't grab the trousers, don't use leg locks, don't flick the genitals. Don't check if it works.

The rigid techniques and rules of a given school tend to lead it to evolve like a species trapped on an island. It becomes hyper-specialized for its environment. But what if the environment changes? The chink in a dojo's proverbial armor can appear during an exhibition match pitting two styles against one another. In 1963, boxer Milo Savage fought judoka Gene LeBell in a contest meant to show the superiority of American boxing.

Things didn't go as the organizers hoped. LeBell threw Savage to the ground and choked him unconscious. It was the first sanctioned mixed martial arts fight in the United States. When two very different hypotheses meet, we may get surprising results. There is in fact no way to know for sure without a fight. It must be tried empirically. We might say it cannot be modeled. Even if we could perfectly mathematize the fighters' abilities and parameterize the dynamics of the fight, the result would still be computationally irreducible. Why simulate the entire universe when the universe will happily simulate itself? [^2] Why not just watch the fight?

Another seminal exhibition fight occurred in 1988 when kickboxer Rick Roufus fought Thai boxer Changpuek Kiatsongrit. The Thai fighter won with a single technique. He kicked Roufus's legs until they stopped working. The technique is common in Thai boxing but was rarely used in American kickboxing. After the fight, Rick's brother, Duke Roufus, said in an interview: 

> I hope that people realize that Thais, if they fight our rules, they're not gonna win. And we're not gonna fight their rules. We experimented tonight but we found out it's not worth it. It doesn't take too much talent to kick to the legs.

Duke eventually became one of America's best Thai boxing coaches. He realized that kickboxing had not yet developed an answer to this simple but effective technique. It was fundamentally unpredictable, but now that an experiment had been run, the truth was out. The challenge now was to systematize such learnings.

The global martial arts community, nascent as it even was, had to find a way of testing techniques repeatedly by running empirical tests rather than aesthetic comparisons or thought experiments. Only then could we hope to discover the truth.

### The Octagon, or the Appeal to Reason and Practical Knowledge

> "A true partnership between the people on the ground managing holistically and the researchers supporting their efforts needs to start with mutual respect. But since the time of Descartes, and the beginning of modern science, society has so elevated the status of the academic researcher and so lowered that of the land manager that generally the researcher speaks with more authority on management today than the person actually managing the farm from day to day and producing food. And this is so even though farmers and pastoralists were the ones who discovered which plants and animals could be domesticated, and then bred thousands of varieties from them several millennia before scientists existed."
> 
> ---     Allan Savory, Holistic Management

The Gracie Challenge was an open invitation to martial arts schools in the Los Angeles valley: Come fight a member of the Gracie family. Kung-fu, judo, and karate practitioners all rose to the challenge hoping to demonstrate the superiority of their art. The grainy footage, most of which dates from the early 1990s, shows a consistent story. The Gracies took their opponents down to the ground and submitted them with a choke or joint lock. Pretty kicks and punches were no match for someone versed in ground fighting. The Gracies' art is now known worldwide as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. BJJ is a cornerstone of modern mixed martial arts training. But in the early 1990s, it was virtually unknown.

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu's story starts with a roaming Japanese emigrant named Mitsuyo Maeda. Born in 1878, Maeda studied judo under its founder, Jigoro. He traveled the world, reportedly winning over 2,000 professional bouts, many against practitioners of other arts. He eventually settled in Brazil where he taught a version of judo with a high emphasis on ground fighting. He called it jiu jitsu. One of Maeda's students was named Carlos Gracie. The art spread through the family and was for a time known as Gracie Jiu Jitsu.

Although BJJ's techniques are like judo's, its culture and training methodology are not. BJJ encourages playful experimentation. New techniques are constantly developed and tested by the community. In comparison, judo has an official list of techniques that can only be edited by an official body. Whereas judo operates on a client/server model, BJJ is truly a peer-to-peer martial art; whereas judo focuses on competition within its community, BJJ was from the start focused on testing itself against other arts; whereas judo seems intent on honing an aesthetic equilibrium, BJJ is a dynamic process: never settling, always looking to discover its own flaws and improve.

The veracity encoded in judo must be trusted; the veracity encoded in BJJ can be verified. The measure of BJJ's success has always been effectiveness. It does not bow to authority nor look to convince with aesthetics. It appeals to reason, or Logos, and it grants knowledge in the form of what James C. Scott calls mētis, in his magisterial Seeing Like a State, which we reference repeatedly. Of this form of knowledge, Scott writes,

Mētis is most applicable to broadly similar but never precisely identical situations requiring a quick and practiced adaptation that becomes almost second nature to the practitioner. The skills of mētis may well involve rules of thumb, but such rules are largely acquired through practice (often in formal apprenticeship) and a developed feel or knack for strategy. Mētis resists simplification into deductive principles which can successfully be transmitted through book learning, because the environments in which it is exercised are too complex and nonrepeatable that formal procedures of rational decision making are impossible to apply. In a sense, mētis lies in that large space between the realm of genius, to which no formula can apply, and the realm of codified knowledge, which can be learned by rote.

Mētis --- hard-won, discovered, evolving practical knowledge --- is needed to act, and where the necessity for human action exists, the knowledge it allows the actor to generate comes about in a helpfully, practically reflexive manner. Scott writes,

We might reasonably think of situated, local knowledge as being partisan knowledge as opposed to generic knowledge. That is, the holder of such knowledge typically has a passionate interest in a particular outcome. An insurer of commercial shipping for a large, highly capitalized maritime firm can afford to rely on probability distributions for accidents. But for a sailor or captain hoping for a safe voyage, it is the outcome of the single event, a single trip, that matters. Mētis is the ability and experience necessary to influence the outcome --- to improve the odds --- in a particular instance.

The mixed martial artist does not want to win a moral or an aesthetic victory, nor does he want to win the hypothetical or the median fight; he wants to win this fight. He has a passionate interest in the particular outcome of his own victory and the avoidance of the physical pain that would come with his own loss. He is deeply motivated to learn in the moment; to treat every action and reaction as an experiment that can improve his performance. He does not want merely to observe the outcome: He wants to influence it.

Back in Los Angeles, Rorion Gracie was looking to reach a wider audience. The family's wins against local martial arts schools spread its reputation across the valley, but not far beyond. In 1993, Rorion created the Ultimate Fighting Championship. It would have "no time limit --- no rules" just like the Challenges. Fighters from all styles would be invited. The Gracie family enlisted Royce Gracie not because he was their best but because his slim frame would make his victory even more of a statement. Royce went on to win the first UFC, defeating bigger and stronger opponents with techniques most had never seen before. BJJ's effectiveness could no longer be denied.

In the twenty-eight years since, much was established --- almost none of which could have been predicted, and certainly not modeled from mathematical models of fighting. Entire arts like Aikido were shown to be ineffective and flashy striking arts like Kung-fu or karate were outcompeted by more prosaic wrestling or boxing. Arts mostly unknown a few decades ago like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or Russian Sambo [^3], both descending from judo, are now considered among the most effective. Today still, new techniques are emerging like the calf kick, which looks to cripple the opponent's leg by hitting a nerve behind the knee.

Each time two fighters step in the Octagon, an experiment ensues. Techniques from all arts are empirically tested for effectiveness. Success means victory. It is not a popularity contest, nor do authority figures decree what does and doesn't work. The mat doesn't lie, as the BJJ saying goes. Try it and see. It's the only test that matters, and only the truth will emerge.

### Going for the Finish, or the Tap Out

"Stop trying to hit me and hit me!"

> ---     Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, The Matrix

The rules of the UFC have drastically increased the cost and reduced the returns of peddling fake martial arts. Bullshit artists can now be called out and the "arts" they espouse have been unequivocally shown to be ineffective. It is not enough for an art to hide behind a veneer of respectability. Authority first needs to prove itself in combat lest it be ignored or even ridiculed.

By introducing a space where fighting ideas could be empirically tested against a creative, motivated, and resisting opponent, the UFC heralded a Golden Age of discovery. The result called Mixed Martial Arts is ever evolving, never static. It is not a destination, but a process. It is not a list of techniques but a mindset to test ideas and adopt any that proves effective in combat. It took Jigoro's insight of "keeping what I felt should be kept, and discarding what I felt should be discarded" and scaled it beyond one man to a community of purposeful actors.

The UFC established new incentives to discover, preserve, and protect truth in a combative but respectful way. Even though its fights are violent affairs, it convinces through non-violent means. It appeals to reason. Unfortunately, until recently in human history non-coercive means of convincing others were necessarily social. And as such, they suffered from Karl Popper's paradox of tolerance where the tolerance of intolerance leads to rule of the latter. In a society of pacifists, the lone dissenter becomes the king.

Violence has only ever been prevented by one of three means: inherent human goodness, perceived benefit from cooperation, or credible or enacted threats of violence greater and more terrifying still. An appreciation for elements of all three is precisely the rationale for learning martial arts, and self-defense in general: That the good and the brave might defend not only themselves, but can cooperate with those who cannot defend themselves, by threatening the malicious with greater inflicted costs than they expect in illegitimate gains.

[^2]:  
[^3]:

This may all sound intellectually impressive at first glance but is really nothing more than pointing out that civilization is superior to a state of nature. That the encouragement of capital and deterrent of morality (i.e., "civilization") have historically been the best and last defenses against violence has given the immoral a clear incentive: Stigmatize and ridicule morality, demonize the honest formation of capital, or infiltrate the institutions intended to support either (voluntarily established or otherwise), and their prospective violence might generate higher returns.

But now this equation features a novel variable, and one tinged with historical irony at that: After millennia of compounding technological advances taking us from the sword and shield to the longbow to the trebuchet to the handgun to the tank to the dreadnought to the fighter jet to the atomic bomb, humanity has discovered a technology that only resists and disincentivizes violence, and has no other use.

In short: Bitcoin fixes this. In long: the remainder of this book.

# Chapter Two

## The Complex Markets Hypothesis

Markets are subjective, uncertain, complex, stochastic, adaptative, and fractal ... but not efficient

Modern academic economics is beholden to mathematics so complex, so obscure, and so removed from the reality it purports to describe and explain as to be effectively impervious to satire.[^1] It is Poe's Law in departmental form. As investors, we, the authors, are professional capital markets participants. But in a past life, we were academically trained not in economics or finance, but in physical geography, environmental systems engineering, hydrology and water resources management, mathematics, philosophy, and computer science, across our various credentials. We believe this unusual combination of knowledge and experience gives us a worthwhile insight into why modern academic economics is such a comical disaster.

We think it is a vicious interplay of three factors, each as unfortunate as the last, each feeding and fed by the others. First: physics envy. This is well understood and is not an original insight. Second, a more specific, material effect of physics envy in this realm: It pushes academic economists to search for what can be measured and quantified, rather than what can or should be understood. Financial markets throw off torrents of data, particularly in recent decades with the advancement of computation and networked computers. Third, and as will become clearer as we develop our thesis in later chapters --- in particular Chapter Five, The Capital Stripe Mine --- financial markets are positioned directly adjacent to the fiat spigot of artificial money. The metaphor may even be more accurate if expressed as financial markets being the spigot. There is no other channel by which counterfeit money can be or ever is pumped into society at large. That is to say, the authors are repentant Cantillonaires, although we really are doing our best to throw off this mantle and reposition ourselves in advance of a Bitcoin standard.

The relevance of this third point --- spigot proximity --- is simple: funding and power. In a sense, these are really the same thing in different guises. If there are billions and billions of dollars,[^2] siphoned primarily from middle-class savers none the wiser, sloshing around an industry that has grown ever more comfortable wielding covert political power, it makes eminent tactical sense for the industry to try to buy legitimacy from an unsuspecting civil society. And at what cost? Basis points, in the scheme of things? Basis points of basis points? Probably more iterations are required. Finance has become nationalized and nations have become financialized. This extractive dance leaves two symbiotic parasites thriving on whatever productive capital survives their ravaging. Tarek El Diwany writes in the preface to the third edition of The Problem with Interest, published just after the global financial crisis,

> No industry other than the banking industry could have raised such huge sums of capital, loans and guarantees in a few short months. That these funds should have been provided with such little conditionality is incomprehensible unless one accepts that some of the most important decisions of government are in fact taken by the banking lobby. At the height of the crisis, one leading public official at a well-known bank remarked to me that "the bankers are in the bunker with the government". Meaningful change cannot be achieved in these circumstances and one is forced to conclude that the present establishment is incapable of reforming itself.

What El Diwany describes may seem circumstantial but is only a single, specific case --- one of which he was personally aware and could knowledgeably comment on --- of a general issue in no way British or contemporary. When Andrew Jackson refused to recharter the Bank of the United States on philosophical and ethical grounds essentially identical to those for which we advocate in this book, the Bank called in all its loans in order to create a recession. Jackson's speech on the matter is as harrowing as it is instructive:

> The distress and alarm which pervaded and agitated the whole country when the Bank of the United States waged war upon the people in order to compel them to submit to its demands cannot yet be forgotten. The ruthless and unsparing temper with which whole cities and communities were oppressed, individuals impoverished and ruined, and a scene of cheerful prosperity suddenly changed into one of gloom and despondency ought to be indelibly impressed on the memory of the people of the United States.
> 
> If such was its power in time of peace, what would it have been in a season of war, with an enemy at our doors? No nation but the freemen of the United States could have come out victorious from such a contest; yet, if you had no conquered, the government would have passed from the hands of the many to the few, and this organized money power, from its secret enclave, would have dictated the choice of your highest officials and compelled you to make peace or war, as best suited their own wishes.

Besides literal political corruption, an obvious yet subtler way to buy legitimacy is to infiltrate the academy and astroturf the meme that "finance" is deeply scientific, needs to be conducted by a professional managerial elite, and needs to be culturally and politically integrated with the institutions of science, engineering, and mathematics. Further, it can even be infused with any self-important thinker of deep thoughts like poets and playwrights, too, if any are up for it or need a quick buck and if none of the regular "scientists" are available. By whatever sneakily propagandistic means necessary, finance must be obfuscated into a systemically important meta-institution to which no respectable person would object.[^3]

Spoiler alert: It is not. This is bullshit. Finance is simple, or at least it should be: You take capital from savers and pass it on to investment projects; you try not to lose it and you try to give back more. You don't get paid a lot for this because it's not hard. The end.

El Diwany brashly but justly opens the preface to the second edition of The Problem with Interest with a brief discussion of premodern medical quackery such as leeches, lack of ventilation, and urine soaking, before his segue to modern academic economics as follows:

> Orthodox views have often proved all-pervasive and wrong, even in the light of facts that state otherwise, established assumptions have an uncanny knack of surviving. It is my contention that such is the case in the field of Western economic debate today. Where once the student asked "does raising the interest rate reduce inflation?" he now askes "by how much must we raise the interest rate in order to reduce inflation?" These are the complacent assumptions of the new "consensus economics."

Many developing nations now reach for the medicines that consensus recommends. But treatments involving "shock therapy" and IMF austerity packages are uncomfortably reminiscent of the remedies of the quacks: extreme in their side effects and of ambiguous benefit. Sometimes, there appears the assertion that things would be worse under any other economic regime, of course, the assertion is untenable because one can never relive the past to know the difference. Meanwhile, consensus economics extends its grasp, and society is increasingly coming to accept pollution, the business cycle, inflation and gross inequalities in wealth as the unavoidable facts of economic life.

The complacent assumptions of the new economic consensus must be, and are, zealously and unrelentingly incepted into the public consciousness in order to obfuscate that finance has gradually shifted over the twentieth century from what we might call a peer-to-peer model to a client/server model. We used to be allowed to learn by experiment by having a good old scrap with our financial competitors. Now we are told what is to be done by decree. Client/server models of any kind of social organization are typically objectionable on the basis of fragility, single points of failure, lack of feedback, and simple unfairness: Who gets to be the server? Who guards the guards? Finance now has an aesthetically minded design that patently doesn't work, and what's more, nobody seems to be bothered that it doesn't work, as if working isn't even the point. Pondering all this for any length of time leads one to realize it goes well beyond finance or economics and arrives at political and moral philosophy. El Diwany would argue it is ultimately a question of religion, and we would be hard-pressed to disagree.

It is a special case of: Is this just? The answer is, of course, no, this is highly unjust, which is why its propagandistic obfuscation is an institutional imperative. Federal Reserve board member Jeremy Rudd recently mused along the same lines, slipping in as a footnote to his September 2021 paper, "Why Do We Think That Inflation Expectations Matter for Inflation? (And Should We?)":

> I leave aside the deeper concern that the primary role of mainstream economics in our society is to provide an apologetics for a criminally oppressive, unsustainable, and unjust social order.[^4]

There is unfathomable institutional power at risk over this being more widely and clearly understood. And while there is a decent case to be made that Bitcoin fixes this,[^5] our goal in writing this book is very simply to make this more widely and clearly understood, such that Bitcoin can fix things faster. As alluded to in the acknowledgements section, the most important meme in Bitcoin is --- or certainly should be, we think --- number of people go up. Bitcoin is software, a protocol, an app, a network, a language: We will get to all of this in due course. But arguably, most importantly, it is a community. None are sufficient but all are necessary. We need "number of people to go up," and we hope we can contribute.

Bitcoin is peer to peer in every sense; it is so by design and it could not be any other way. As free and open source, it is peer-to-peer software; as consensus-driven software, it is a peer-to-peer protocol; as a censorship-resistant protocol, it is a peer-to-peer app; as a distributed app, it is a peer-to-peer network; as a communications network, it is a peer-to-peer language; and as a peaceful language, it is a peer-to-peer community.

The client/server fiat finance and monetary model is none of these things, cannot be any of these things, and will never be any of these things. It is a closed-source, non-consensual, censorial, centralized, incomprehensible, violent system. It is unsurprising, therefore, that its system administrators would prefer to muddy the waters on how, exactly, it all works.

In light of all this, we think that finance is a natural place to begin our analysis. This serves three distinct purposes. First, we suspect most readers are more familiar with the likes of banks, brokers, stocks, and bonds than they are with the more abstract concept of "capitalism." If so, this may be a gentler introduction before we get into the meat of our argument.

Second, we intend to shatter false idols as early and as dramatically as we possibly can. The financial services industry hides behind nonsensical mathematical obscurantism in order to shield itself from criticism from the regular people, whom it has convinced no longer really understand what they are trying to criticize and don't really know how to express their criticism in a way that even makes any sense.[^6]

But this is easy: It is nonsensical mathematical obscurantism. This chapter will walk the reader through a forensic deconstruction of the discipline's crowning glory: the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) from which modern portfolio theory flows and, by extension, pretty much all of contemporary academic finance. We will go into much more detail later in this chapter, but the EMH may be reasonably, if satirically, characterized as: The price in a financial market is by definition correct. Hopefully, the reader cringed at the flagrantly self-serving nature of this preposterous claim, never mind its illogical, epistemologically questionable, and radically unscientific form.

The third purpose of beginning with finance loops back to the first few paragraphs of this chapter: In a perversely rational attempt to satisfy misplaced physics envy, access never-ending reams of irrelevant data on which statistical analysis can nonsensically be performed, and remain as close to the money spigot as possible, modern academic economics has spontaneously reorganized itself around the kind of self-serving thinking implicit in the EMH --- and academic finance around this very idea. Similar to our desire to ease the reader into the subject matter, analytically demolishing this shibboleth also serves to ease the reader into our mental models and toolkit. We will go on to reapply more or less the same concepts in analyzing money, financial capital, social capital, Bitcoin, and more in later chapters. We have already done so in mixed martial arts.

Our overall thesis can arguably be reduced to a handful of dichotomies contrasting approaches to the study of human action and the configuration of human relations in all their forms. These dichotomies include:

- design versus evolution
- stasis versus dynamism
- equilibrium versus process
- modelling versus experimentation
- trust versus verification
- decree versus discovery
- rationality versus heuristics

Modern academic economists may not think they are interested in how to price securities, but they are intensely interested in designing static equilibrium models, trusting this methodology, and decreeing all else to be irrational. Hence, whether they like it or not, modern academic economists have been seduced by the idea that the question of how to price securities can even be answered.

Our argument in this chapter will go through the following propositions, which serve as headings for their own sections of discussion:

- Value is subjective
- Uncertainty is not risk
- Economic complexity resists equilibria
- Markets aggregate prices, not information
- Markets tend to leverage efficiency

We will offer commentary on Andrew Lo's adaptive markets hypothesis, Benoit Mandelbrot's interpretation of fractal geometry in financial markets, and George Gilder's discussion of information theory. We will also occasionally invoke the concepts of “reflexivity,” as articulated by George Soros in The Alchemy of Finance, and several simple heuristics such as “skin in the game” and “robustness.”

This might seem like an excessive coverage list just to offer a counter to the claim that markets are “efficient,” which seems pretty reasonable in and of itself. If it is at all reassuring to the reader before diving in, we don't think our thesis has five intimidating-sounding propositions, so much as one quite simple idea, from which many related propositions can be shown to follow. We think that, fundamentally, the EMH is contradicted by the implications of value being subjective, and that some basic elements of complex systems are helpful, in places, to nudge the reasoning along. If it isn't too arrogant, we think this insight can be helpfully extended to all of economics, which we will do in much of the rest of the book. And if the reader suspects this is arrogant, our immediate retort would likely be that this does not reflect that we are clever, but that economics is simple, albeit perhaps not easy.

As for this chapter, and helpfully referring to the split just mentioned, there is an important point we want to stress that is implicit in much of the book: Finance is utterly broken with or without Bitcoin. It has increasingly become a self-referential game that enriches only its participants by moving money yet destroying wealth. It is so desperately, irreparably broken that its insidious influence has infiltrated not just modern academic economics — as just claimed and as argued in later chapters — but, via the financialization of everything... everything. It is as much a cancer of the discourse as of the markets. A society in which barely literate, degenerate options traders spouting garbled charlatanic bullshit are revered as purveyors of ancient wisdom is surely broken and decadent by any sound assessment. The rare few financiers who are committed to the actually ancient and wise practice of taking capital from savers and passing it on to investment projects, trying not to lose it and trying to give back more, sadly suffer with the rest of us. And this assumes it is even possible to perform this role successfully in the first place. Often, it is not.

Although Chapter Three, This Is Not Capitalism, tackles this more directly, while this chapter is really more of a theoretical debunking, we ask the reader to remember that the theory only exists in the first place to retroactively justify the practice. Incidentally, this lends itself to autobiographical detail: This is how the authors first came to appreciate Bitcoin. Before we thought it might be possible that Bitcoin can finance, we knew that it was true that finance needed to be fixed.

A common criticism of Bitcoin, albeit naïve and superficial, is that it is a solution looking for a problem. This is what we aim to debunk. The problems are terrifyingly real, and for reasons we will explain in later chapters, many lead back to money — which is to say, to finance, in one way or another. In the client/server model of finance, they are one and the same thing. The reader is encouraged to keep in the back of their mind an aphorism beloved of Bitcoiners the world over, should the following at times seem a little too theoretical:

Fix the money, fix the world.

### Value Is Subjective

> "Not everybody's gonna dig what I dig, but I reserve the right to dig it."  
> --- Whoopi Goldberg

You shouldn't compare apples and oranges, except that sometimes you have to, like when you are hungry. If apples and oranges are the same price, you need to make a decision that simply cannot be mathematized. You either like apples more than oranges or vice versa. And actually, even this may not be true. Maybe you know full well you like oranges, but you just feel like an apple today, or you need apples for a pie recipe for which oranges would be très gauche. This reasoning is readily extended in all directions — which is objectively better — a novel by Dickens or Austen? A hardback or an eBook by either or anybody? And what about the higher order capital goods that go into producing apples, oranges, novels, Kindles, and the like? Clearly, they are “worth” only whatever their buyer subjectively assesses as likely to be a worthwhile investment given the (again) subjective valuations of others as to the worth of apples, oranges, novels, and whatnot ....

This is all fine and dandy and readily understood since the marginal revolution of Menger, Jevons, and Walras in the 1870s rigorously refuted cost and labor theories of value. As Menger put it in Principles of Economics, probably still the best theoretical introduction to economics,

    Value is thus nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, nor an independent thing existing by itself. It is a judgment economizing men make about the importance of the goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and well-being. Hence value does not exist outside the consciousness of men.

Fair enough. But the first seductive trappings of the EMH come from the rarely articulated assumption that such essential subjectivity is erased in financial markets because the goods in the market are defined only in terms of cash flows. There may not be an answer as to whether apples are better than oranges, but surely $10 is better than $5? And surely $10 now is better than $10 in the future? But what about $5 now or $10 in the future?

There are (at least) two reasons this reductionism is misleading. The first comes from the mainstream treatment of temporal discounting, which is to assume that only exponential discounting can possibly be “optimal.” The widespread prevalence of alternative approaches — hyperbolic discounting, for example — is then usually treated via behavioral economics, as a deviation from optimality that is evidence of irrational cognitive biases.

This has been challenged by Alex Adamou, Yonatan Berman, Diomides Mavroyiannis, and Ole Peters, in their paper, "The Microfoundations of Discounting," [^1] in which the authors argue that the single assumption of an individual aiming to optimize the growth rate of their wealth can generate different discounting regimes that are optimal relative to the conditions by which their wealth grows in the first place. This in turn rests on the relationship between their current wealth and the payments that may be received. Sometimes the discounting that pops out is exponential, sometimes hyperbolic, sometimes something else entirely. It depends on their circumstances.

We would editorialize here that an underlying cause of confusion is that people value time itself, and, naturally, do so subjectively.[^2] It may be fair enough to say that they typically want to use their time as efficiently as possible — or grow their wealth the fastest — but this is rather vacuous in isolation. Padding it out with circumstantial information immediately runs into the fact that everybody's circumstances are different. As Adamou said on Twitter shortly after the paper's first release, "Not many ninety-year-olds play the stock market." It's funny because it's true.

And it is easy to see how this result can be used as a wedge to pry open a conceptual can of worms. In financial markets, there are far more variables to compare than just the discount rate — and if we can't even assess an objective discount rate, we really are in trouble! In choosing between financial assets, we are choosing between uncertain and non-deterministic streams of future cash flows, as well as (maybe, who knows?) desiring to preserve some initial capital value. Assume these cash flows are “risky,” in the sense that we can assign probabilities to their space of outcomes.[^3] There can be no objective answer because different market participants could easily have different risk preferences, exposure preferences, liquidity needs, time frames, and so on.

Time frames are worth dwelling on for a second longer because this points to an ill definition in our hasty setup of the problem: To what space of outcomes are we assigning probabilities, exactly? Financial markets do not have an end point, so this makes no sense on the face of it. If we amend by suggesting (clearly ludicrously) that the probabilities are well defined for every interval's end point, forever, then we invite the obvious criticism that different participants may care about different sequences of intervals. Particularly if their different discount rates (which we admitted they must have) have a different effect on how far in the future cash flows have to come to be discounted back to a value that is negligible in the present. Once again, people value time itself subjectively.

In the readily understood language employed just above, market participants almost certainly have different circumstances to one another, from which different subjective valuations will naturally emerge. What seems to you like a stupidly low price at which to sell an asset might be ideal for the seller because they are facing a margin call elsewhere in their portfolio,[^4] or because they hold too much of this asset for their liking and want to rebalance their exposure. Or perhaps some price might seem stupidly high to buy, but the buyer has a funding gap so large that they need to invest in something that has a non-zero probability of appreciating by that much. If you need to double your money, then the “risk-free asset” is infinitely risky. There is no right answer, because value is subjective.

### Uncertainty Is Not Risk

> "Many idle controversies involving the nature of expectation could be avoided by recognizing at the outset that man's conscious actions are the reflection of his beliefs and nothing else."  
> --- Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, "The Nature of Expectation and Uncertainty"

"Risk" characterizes a non-deterministic system for which the space of possible outcomes can be assigned probabilities. Expected values are meaningful and hence prices, if they exist in such a system, lend themselves to effective hedging. "Uncertainty" characterizes a non-deterministic system for which probabilities cannot be assigned to the space of outcomes. Uncertain outcomes cannot be hedged. The proposition is meaningless.[^5] This distinction in economics is usually credited to Frank Knight and his wonderful 1921 book, Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit. In the introduction, Knight writes,

    It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or "risk" proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all. We shall accordingly restrict the term "uncertainty" to cases of the non-quantitative type. It is this "true" uncertainty, and not risk, as has been argued, which forms the basis of a valid theory of profit and accounts for the divergence between actual and theoretical competition.

Keynes is often also credited an excellent exposition,

    By "uncertain" knowledge, let me explain, I do not mean merely to distinguish what is known for certain from what is only probable. The game of roulette is not subject, in this sense, to uncertainty [...] Or, again, the expectation of life is only slightly uncertain. Even the weather is only moderately uncertain. The sense in which I am using the term is that in which the prospect of a European war is uncertain, or the price of copper and the rate of interest twenty years hence, or the obsolescence of a new invention, or the position of private wealth owners in the social system in 1970. About these matters there is no scientific basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever. We simply do not know. Nevertheless, the necessity for action and for decision compels us as practical men to do our best to overlook this awkward fact and to behave exactly as we should if we had behind us a good Benthamite calculation of a series of prospective advantages and disadvantages, each multiplied by its appropriate probability, waiting to be summed.[^6]

The conclusion of the Keynes passage is particularly helpful as it gets at why it is so important to be clear on the difference, which otherwise might seem like little more than semantics: People need to act. They will strive for a basis to treat uncertainty as if it were risk so as to tackle it more easily, but however successful they are or are not, they must act nonetheless.

Knight hints at the direction of the argument of Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit, which we will summarize here: Profit is the essence of competitive uncertainty. Were there no uncertainty, but merely quantifiable risk in patterns of production and consumption, competition would drive all prices to a stable and commoditized equilibrium. In financial vocabulary, we would say there would be no such thing as a sustainable competitive advantage. The cost of capital would be the risk-free rate, as would all returns on capital, meaning profit would be minimized. In aggregate, profit would function merely as a kind of force pulling all economic activity to this precise point of strong attraction.

But of course, uncertainty is very real. In the economic realm uncertainty is a direct consequence of subjective value; in engaging in pursuing profit, you are guessing what others will value. As Knight later writes, "With uncertainty present, doing things, the actual execution of activity, becomes in a real sense a secondary part of life; the primary problem or function is deciding what to do and how to do it."

So far, we have danced around the keyword and concept here, but this "deciding what to do and how to do it," and "pursuing profit," we call entrepreneurship. In a world with uncertainty, the role of the entrepreneur is to shoulder the uncertainty of untried combinations of capital, the success of which will ultimately be dependent on the subjective valuations of others. This is not something that can be calculated, simulated, or modeled, as any entrepreneur will tell you.[^1] It is a process of dynamic discovery. As Ross Emmett noted in his centennial review of Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit, it is no coincidence that the word "judgment" appears on average every two pages in the book.[^2]

You can't just imagine starting a business; you have to actually do it in order to learn anything. And, in order to do it, you have to expose yourself to your own successes and failures. Your experiment changes the system in which you are experimenting, and you will inevitably have a stake in the experiment's result.[^3] This is fertile ground in which to plant Soros's theory of reflexivity. As briefly as possible, and certainly not doing it justice, Soros believes that financial markets are fundamentally resistant to truly scientific analysis, because they can only be fully understood in such a way that acknowledges the fact that thinking about the system influences the system. He writes that the scientific method,

> Is clearly not applicable to reflexive situations because even if all the observable facts are identical, the prevailing views of the participants are liable to be different when an experiment is repeated. The very fact that an experiment has been conducted is liable to change the perceptions of the participants. Yet, without testing, generalizations cannot be falsified.[^4]

All potential entrepreneurial activity is uncertain (by definition), but the fact of engaging in it crystallizes the knowledge of its success or failure. The subjective valuations on which its success depends are revealed by the experiment, and you can't repeat the experiment pretending you don't now know this information. Alternatively, this can be conceived of in terms of the difference between thinking and acting, or talking and doing. In a reflexive environment, you can't say what would have happened had you done something, because, had you done it, you would have changed the circumstances that lead to you now claiming you would have done it. As Yogi Berra (allegedly) said, "In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice, there is."

We can also now invoke "skin in the game," a phrase of dubious origin — possibly originating in a 1986 Wall Street Journal article[^5] — and indicating a financial stake of some or other kind, exposing somebody to the consequences of their actions, good or both. "Skin in the game" is often advocated for in both a moral sense of those making the decisions deserving the outcome, but also in the sense of optimal system design, in that such an arrangement encourages people to behave the most prudently out of all possible incentive schemes. Braving the wild uncertainties of entrepreneurship requires capital. It requires a stake on which the entrepreneur might get the upside of profit but might get the downside of loss. We say "might" because you cannot possibly know the odds of such a wager. It relies not on risk but on uncertainty.

The combined appreciation of "judgment" and "skin in the game" is key to understanding what entrepreneurs are actually doing. They do not merely throw capital into a combinatorial vacuum; they are intuiting the wants and needs of potential customers. As the economist Alex Tabarrok says, "a bet is a tax on bullshit. Or, don't talk: do."

The aforementioned Emmett review of Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit also noted that the very concept of Knightian uncertainty re-emerged in the public consciousness around a decade ago due to two events: The role ironically played by financial risk instruments in the financial crisis, which neo-classical economists had up until that point insisted would reduce uncertainty in markets,[^6] and Twitter celebrity and former practitioner of late-stage fiat finance Nassim Taleb publishing the bestseller The Black Swan. Emmett writes,

> Taleb did not suggest that uncertainty could be handled by risk markets. Instead, he made a very Knightian argument: since you cannot protect yourself entirely against uncertainty, you should build robustness into your personal life, your company, your economic theory, and even the institutions of your society, to withstand uncertainty and avoid tragic results. These actions imply costs that may limit other aspects of your business, and even your openness to new opportunity.

But enough about entrepreneurship, what about financial markets? Well, financial markets are readily understood as one degree removed from entrepreneurship. With adequate mental flexibility, the reader can think of them as markets for negotiable fractions of entrepreneurial activity. Entrepreneurship-by-proxy, we might say. If you want, you can use them to mimic the uncertainty profile of an entrepreneur: Your "portfolio" could be 100% the equity of the company you wish you founded. Or 200%, with leverage, if you are really gung-ho! But most people think precisely the opposite way: Markets present the opportunity to tame the rabid uncertainty of entrepreneurship, as it always naturally exists in isolation, and skim some portion of its aggregate benefit.[^7]

There is an additional complication. The fact of such markets usually being liquid enough to enable widespread ownership creates the incentive to think not about the underlying entrepreneurship at all, but only about the expectations of other market participants — to ignore the fundamentals and consider only the valuation. There are shades of Soros's reflexivity here. The market depends to some extent on the thinking of those participating in the market about the market. This is sometimes called a Keynesian beauty contest, after Keynes's analogy of judging a beauty contest not on the basis of who you think is most beautiful, but on the basis of who you think others will think is the most beautiful. If everybody is doing that, then you really need to judge on the basis of who you think others will think ... others will think — and so on — is the most beautiful.

Unlike the entrepreneur, who must only worry about the subjective valuation of his potential customers, participants in financial markets must worry, in addition, about the subjective valuation of this subjective valuation by other market participants. This might induce grumbling at this point that this represents "speculation" as opposed to "investment," and we certainly believe that, over time periods long enough to reflect real economic activity allowed for by the investments, such concerns will make less and less of a difference. As Benjamin Graham famously said, "In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." But the voting still happens. It is clearly real and needs to be accounted for. Risk is once again useless. Uncertainty abounds.

This range of possibilities is intriguing and points to a deeper understanding of what financial markets really are: The aim of a great deal of finance is to grapple with the totality of uncertainty inherent in entrepreneurial activity — equally well understood as "investment of capital," given the need for a "stake" — by partitioning it into different exposures that can sensibly be described as relatively more or less "risky." The aim of doing so is generally to minimize the cost of capital going towards real investment by tailoring the packaging of uncertainty to the "risk profiles" of those willing to invest, as balanced by escalating transaction costs if this process becomes too fine-grained.

This is the essence of a capital structure: The more senior the capital claim, the better defined the probability space of outcomes for that instrument. Uncertainty in aggregate cannot be altered, nor can its influence be completely removed from individual instruments, but exposure to uncertainty can be unevenly parceled out amongst instruments.

This suggests a far more sophisticated understanding of "the risk/reward trade-off" and "the equity premium" than is generally accepted in the realm of modern portfolio theory, and, by extension, the EMH: Bonds are likely to get a lower return than stocks not because they are less "risky" (which in that context is even more questionably interpreted as "less volatile"), but because they are engineered to be less uncertain. The burden of uncertainty is deliberately shifted from debt to equity. You don't get a "higher reward" for taking on the "risk/volatility" of equities; you deliberately expose yourself to the uncertain possibility of a greater reward in exchange for accepting an uncertain possibility of a greater loss.

It is worth pondering for a second that this is arguably why the "equity risk premium" even exists and why modern academic economists are so confused about how much it differs from what their models and theories predict, while financial professionals are not in the slightest. If there really were no uncertainty in investment and every enterprise — and hence every financial instrument linked to it — had a modellable risk profile, then price discrepancies derivable from expectation values could be arbitraged away. There would be no equity risk premium nor a risk premium of any kind on any asset. Everything would be priced correctly and volatility would be zero. That volatility is never zero clearly invalidates this idea. We suggest that the distinction between risk and uncertainty provides at least part of the explanation: Unless, by remarkable coincidence, every market participant's opportunity costs (of exposure, liquidity, time, etc.) and perception of uncertainty (of fundamentals, others' perceptions of fundamentals, others' perceptions of others' perceptions, etc.) is all identical, and remains so over a period of time, price-altering trading will occur.[^8]

An important formal concept to appreciate in the context of uncertainty is that of "heuristics." This is a worthwhile loose end to tie up before moving on from uncertainty, along with that of, "randomness and unpredictability."

This is quite a simple idea that originates with Herbert Simon and has been taken up with force more recently by Gerd Gigerenzer.[^9] Simon's framing began by assuming that individuals do not, in fact, have perfect information, nor the resources to compute perfectly optimal decisions. Given these constraints, Simon proposed that individuals demonstrate bounded rationality; they will be as rational as they can, given the information and resources they actually have. This probably sounds straightforward enough — perhaps tautological — but notice it flies in the face of behavioral economics, which tends to cover for neo-classical economics by saying, effectively, that since information and competition are perfect, risk is always defined and the optimal decision can always be calculated, but the reason people don't do so is that they are hopelessly irrational. We have always thought this is quite silly on the face of it, but it is clearly also seductive. Anybody reading the likes of Thinking, Fast and Slow immediately gets the intellectual rush of thinking everybody is stupid except themselves.

Bounded rationality encourages the development of "heuristics," with which the reader may be familiar, if only due to behavioral economists frequently railing against the concept. A heuristic is a rule of thumb for dealing with an uncertain environment that you are pretty sure will work even if you can't explain why, precisely. The classic example is that of a dog and a frisbee, or an outfielder in baseball catching a flyball: The outfielder could solve enough differential equations to calculate the spot the ball will land, but the dog certainly can't. And it turns out that neither do: In real life, they adjust their running speed and direction such that the angle at which they see the frisbee or ball stays constant. And it works. No equations required.

The implied simplicity of heuristics has subtle mathematical importance as well. A more technical way of specifying this is to say that they have very few parameters — discrete, independent information inputs to the decision procedure — and, ideally, they could even have zero. In a purely risky environment, a decision procedure ought to have as many parameters as are needed to accurately model the underlying probability distribution. But the more uncertainty you add to such an environment, the more dangerous this becomes, essentially because what you are doing is fine-tuning your model to an environment that simply no longer exists. Eventually you will get an unforeseen and unforeseeable fluctuation so large that your overfitted model gives you a truly awful suggestion.

Heuristics are robust to such circumstances in light of having very few parameters to begin with. Think back to the outfielder: Imagine they solve all the necessary fluid dynamical equations, taking account of the fly ball's mass, velocity, and rotation; the air's viscosity; the turbulence generated; and so on and so forth. If there is then a gust of wind, they're screwed. Their calculation will be completely wrong. But if they embrace the heuristic of just looking at the damn ball this won't matter!

Gigerenzer is fond of pointing out that Harry Markowitz — considered the founder of modern portfolio theory — didn't actually use any Nobel Prize–winning modern portfolio theory for his own retirement portfolio; he used the zero-parameter 1/n approach. If one were being especially mean-spirited, one might say that he didn't want his own bullshit to be taxed. And as it turns out, in order for the Markowitz many-many-many-parameter approach to investing to consistently outperform 1/n, you would need around 500 years of data to fine-tune the parameters. Of course, you also need the market to not change at all in that time. Good luck with that.

Since markets feature multitudes of interrelated uncertainties, it is reasonable to expect participants to interact with them not with the perfect rationality of provably optimal behavior, but with the bounded rationality of heuristics, which are selected on the basis of judgment, intuition, creativity, etc. Basically, people mostly are not stupid. And if they are, they have skin in the game, so they get punished and possibly wiped out. To paraphrase John Kay and Melvyn King's discussion in Radical Uncertainty, organizations that understand the irreducibility of uncertainty focus on resilience and adaptability. They aim to at least survive and ideally benefit from uncertainty. Those that believe in the neo-classical model of rational expectations emphasize forecast accuracy and operational efficiency. The Global Financial Crisis empirically demonstrated how brittle a banking system guided by complex risk models really was.

A cute conceptual corollary to risk is not uncertainty is, unpredictability is not randomness. There can be unpredictable events that are not random, and randomness that is not unpredictable. And, moreover, we would argue these are not even binaries, nor ends of a spectrum, but strictly untranslatable given uncertainty is a psychological characteristic and randomness a mathematical one. The random can be so fundamentally complex as to only be comprehensible by a human mind as uncertain, and the uncertain can defy modelling as random because it is more than merely complicated: It is creative, intuitive, human.

The difference essentially comes down to causation — a concept with which modern academic economists are deeply uncomfortable — and the ability of humans to intuit causation and confirm their intuition via sound experimentation. Think of biological evolution, to which we will return as a useful metaphor several times. This is, strictly speaking, a random process. Genes do not think. Yet, the mechanism by which a given species evolves is so incomprehensibly complicated that any human attempt to treat it as "random" — to model it and to deduce and statistically quantify its potential paths — cannot be taken seriously.

Or think of Keynes's example of the obsolescence of a new invention. This is "unpredictable" not because it is subject to an extremely complicated probability density function, but because the path of causation that would lead to such a situation involves such obvious genuine uncertainty as to defy probabilistic causality. Or think even of the bitcoin mining process. The time series of the first non-zero character in the hash of every block is certifiably random, but it is not unpredictably random. It is the result of a highly coordinated and purposeful effort. Because we understand the causal process by which this time series emerges, we can predict this randomness very effectively.

A key building block of the EMH is the "random walk hypothesis": The idea that you can "prove," using statistical methods, that stock prices follow "random walks" — a kind of well-defined and genuinely random mathematical behavior. But you can do no such thing. You can prove that they are indistinguishable from random walks, but that is really just saying you can use a statistical test to prove that some data can pass a statistical test. If you understand what causes price movements, you will arrive at no such nonsense as claiming that the moves are, themselves, random. They very probably look random because they are fundamentally unpredictable from the data. And they are fundamentally unpredictable from the data, because they derive from the incalculable interplay of millions of market participants' subjective assessments of the at-root uncertain process of entrepreneurship.

None of this is based on randomness, nor "risk," nor "luck." It is based on the unknown and unknowable reinvested profit that results from intuiting the results of untried and unrepeatable experiments and backing one's intuition with skin in the game.

Before moving on, we think it is worth tying all of this to where it is more tangibly sensible. A big deal was made around the turn of 2020 about Netflix being by far the best performing US mid-to-large-cap stock of the 2010s. Netflix is useful as an example because of the scale of its success, but note the following argument does not depend on scale at all. While the reader could craft an explanation as complicated as they like, we think saying, streaming is better than cable, pretty much does it, once added to all the circumstantial factors to do with the competitive and technological environment.

[^1]: Reference [16].
[^2]: Reference [17].
[^3]: Reference [18].
[^4]: Reference [19].
[^5]: Reference [20].
[^6]: Reference [21].
[^7]: Reference [22].
[^8]: Reference [23].
[^9]: Reference [24].

Now imagine an investor in 2010 whose thesis was that streaming is better than cable and would likely win in the long run, who surveyed the competitive environment, and decided Netflix would be a good investment. Is their outperformance over the next ten years "luck"? Was all the "information" "in the price" in 2010? Would the Capital Asset Pricing model have told them what the price should have been? Did the stock go for a nice little random walk to the moon?

This is clearly an insane interpretation. Consider the alternative: The investor better intuited the subjective values of future consumers than did the average market participant. Very likely they justified this on the basis of a heuristic or two. They staked capital on this bet --- which was not risky and random but uncertain and unpredictable --- and exposed themselves to a payoff that turned out to be huge, because they were right! And for that matter, all successful long-term investments can frankly be reduced to one parameter (how's that for a heuristic?): X is going to change.

For Netflix, X was "the consumption of video content." For Amazon, X was "the default choice for consumer purchasing." For Bitcoin, X was, and still is, "money." One could model absolutely everything under the sun and pop out the "correct" price of Netflix on February 9, 2034, but one needn't do so --- and for that matter, one probably shouldn't. A little numeracy certainly wouldn't hurt, but, otherwise, judgment, intuition, creativity, and heuristics will do just fine.

To the peddlers of the EMH, rational expectations, perfect information, and the like, this obviously sensible interpretation is utterly heretical.

### Economic Complexity Resists Equilibria

> "In equilibrium systems, everything adds up nicely and linearly. It is trivial to generalize to many agents; this simply corresponds to connecting more glasses of water. The effect on the water level from adding several drops of water is proportional to the number of drops. One does not have to think about the individual drops. In physics, we refer to this kind of treatment where only a global macrovariable, such as the water level, is considered as a 'mean field approximation.' Traditional economic theories are mean field theories in that they deal with macrovariables, such as the gross national product (GNP), the unemployment rate, and the interest rate. Economists develop mathematical equations that are supposed to connect these variables. The differences in individual behaviour average out in this kind of treatment. No historical accident can change the equilibrium state, since the behaviour of rational agents is unique and completely defined. Mean field treatments work quite well in physics for systems that are either very ordered or very disordered. However, they completely fail for systems that are at or near a critical state. Unfortunately, there are many indications that economics systems are in fact critical."
