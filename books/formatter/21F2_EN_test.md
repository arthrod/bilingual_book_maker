Foreword

Fiction has long been a powerful tool for understanding the complexities of our current social paradigm and extrapolating where it might lead us in the future. By exploring the possibilities of tomorrow, we can gain valuable insights into the consequences of our actions today and hopefully chart a course towards a less violent and more prosperous future.

The stories collected in this volume offer a glimpse into a wide range of possible futures, each one a thought-provoking commentary on the world we live in today. From the dystopian landscape of 'Infinite Debt', where individuals are trapped in a never-ending cycle of debt and control, to the post-apocalyptic world of 'The Big Slash', where society has broken down and people must adapt to survive, these tales challenge us to think critically about the systems and structures that govern our lives.

Other stories, such as Proxy --- Temet Nosce and We Are Living Well, explore themes of identity, community, and resilience in the face of catastrophic change. They invite us to consider what it means to be ourselves in a world where technology is increasingly shaping our experiences and relationships. Meanwhile, 'Supplying the Slugs' offers a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and exploitation, highlighting the importance of responsibility and ethics in our interactions with others.

Yet, despite the challenges and dangers these stories portray, there is also a sense of hope and optimism that runs throughout this collection. For example, technologies like Bitcoin and Nostr are providing new opportunities for individuals to take control of their own lives and create more equitable systems. These freedom-enhancing technologies have the potential to decentralize power, promote transparency, and foster greater cooperation and collaboration.

As we look to the future, it is clear that our choices will have far-reaching consequences. The stories in this volume encourage us to think carefully about the kind of world we want to create and to work towards building a future that is more just, peaceful, and prosperous for all.

Introduction

As the 'financial fallout' of an inflation-driven nuclear winter fast approaches, we cling to the promise of a warmer spring, brought about by exciting new technologies and the familiar comfort of storytelling.

The cypherpunks have arisen --- individuals who believe privacy enhances, not detracts from, our place in society. Individuals who believe that with new technology, we can empower each other and ourselves, and de-power those who would see us live as nothing more than digital serfs.

Individuals who believe.

These tales, from established writers and emerging talents, imagine worlds that could be free but aren't, much like our own. As 21 Futures evolves from its bitcoin origins in Tales from the Timechain, we turn now to darker possible fates. Inspired by uncertainty, our writers hold the keys to brighter futures, if only we can survive the fallout.

From thought-provoking and funny to downright frightening, the stories in this anthology captured our hearts and minds. They grapple with the rise of surveillance capitalism, the erosion of privacy, and the struggle for economic freedom. Yet, amidst the dystopia, a glimmer of hope persists...these stories are not merely warnings; they are invitations to imagine --- and ultimately, to build --- a better future. We invite you to join us.

Infinite Debt, our top-prize story by Graeme Shimmin, asks its characters and our audience how far they might be willing to go to write off debt.

Proxy --- Temet Nosce, offers a body-horror experience that is as frightening as it is entertaining when the protagonist is transformed into a NoBody.

The Big Slash offers a glimpse of what post-AI life might be like, and our joint runners-up stories, We are Living Well and Supplying The Slugs offer a more fantastical edge to the collection.

Underworld reveals a terrifying vision of government surveillance and the cypherpunk freedom fighters who fight the system.

Special thanks to Max Hillebrand for sponsoring this volume and contributing his work.

And so the Konsensus Network team, the editors, and the authors take on the role of doomed Prometheus, passing the fire of hope and the future to you, dear reader.

This is a short story collection for those who can see what's coming, and choose hope instead of fear.

Enjoy.

The Big Slash

by *D.J. Bodden*

I was in a grocery store when The Big Slash happened. I was bagging my own groceries at the self-checkout stand, as is the right of every post-AI human. It was the end of the workday and near closing time, so the place was packed with tired, oblivious office workers who'd gone from one rat race to another. Some of them were like slow zombies, and some of them were fast, shoving and snarling like they needed to get somewhere other than a honeycomb pod motel.

I was uncomfortable and anxious. Some hulking gym bro who was 'just buying a six-pack' was breathing over my shoulder, the smell assaulting my personal space like an uninvited back rub. I'd just managed to stuff the last of my groceries into a biodegradable bag, gray veggie-plastic stretched almost transparent, and I just wanted to get out of there and back to my crappy apartment.

I punched the checkout button, swiped my hand over the reader, and grabbed my stuff. 'Hey, buddy!' the dude with the beer cans said, catching my elbow before I'd taken a second step. I flinched at the touch, turning with cosmic reluctance toward the possibility of confrontation, but Mr. Pecs-too-big-for-his-wife-beater was pointing at the register. Payment declined.

'Sorry,' I said without making eye contact, and I put my hand back on the terminal, making sure the RFID scanner got a good look at the chip in the meaty part of my hand. Payment declined.

Cold sweat dripped down my spine. Have you ever had that feeling? Sudden impotence. I turned to apologize to the man I'd been belittling in my head only moments before, but again, he wasn't looking at me, so all I saw was the back of his head. He was looking at all the other registers, where dozens of other formerly confident and self-sufficient customers searched, helpless, for an attendant.

I don't think I ever saw his face. I just remember the smell --- sweat and halitosis. It was the first waft of a new world. The Big Slash had come for us all.

◆◆◆

I woke up the next morning in my small apartment. Well, not exactly mine. I owned an eighth of a year in a room that barely fit a single bed, some shelves, and a portable stove. Shared bathroom on every floor. It sucked.

Oh, and the door was broken. The lock had been keyed to my share tokens, and my chip still didn't work. I was tired, hungry, and pissed off, so I did the manliest thing I'd done until that point in my life. What? No, of course I didn't break the door down. I borrowed a pry bar from my ex-con neighbor, and it was scary as hell. Still better than sleeping in the hallway.

I'd woken up, hungry and still tired, immediately reaching for my tablet to sign into my chip. It was still locked, both main account and subaccounts, same as the dozen times before. I still remember that feeling. Not even anger or frustration, although there had been no shortage of that the night before. No, that morning, I felt a sense of doom that I can only describe as wide-eyed certainty my life was over. The chip was dead. My life went with it.

If you grew up after the Slash, you might not understand what I'm talking about, but the thing in my hand was called a wallet although, for reasons that don't matter anymore, it should have been called a keyring. It held the keys to my money, my property, and my government ID. It unlocked proof of my bachelor's degree, my work history, and my failed marriage to Jenny Larsh. I'd lost access to my streaming account, my music, and my books because I didn't really own any of them, I just owned the right to access them. I could only log into the tablet as a guest, so I'd lost all of my contacts, and even if I'd had them, I could only call emergency services. I'd become a non-person overnight.

I hugged my arms across my chest, staring up at the ceiling, literally trying to get a hold of myself.

After a few hundred thunderous heartbeats, my faith in normality gasped for air. I could open a new wallet. I could get people who knew me to vouch for my existence. My family lived in a different town --- so did I, seven-eighths of the year --- but if I could get to them, I could partially prove my identity by association and maybe get my pre-college education restored.

I also had a physical copy of my passphrases buried in my parents' back yard, but I wasn't sure if that would fix this. The terminal wasn't giving me the option to recover anything. I was just locked out without explanation or recourse, and that threatened to freeze me up again. First things first, I told myself, dragging myself back from the edge of hopelessness. I need to find someone who knows me, and maybe ask to borrow their tablet. As sad as it might sound, the only place for that was corporate headquarters since I worked remotely from my hometown most of the year.

I walked down the hall to take a quick shower, pulled some clothes from the suitcase I was living out of, and headed for work. I was expecting an hour-long walk --- I didn't have a way to pay for a self-driving commuter, and even public transportation required payment or a residency pass --- but after just a few steps onto the sidewalk, I realized I had misunderstood the scope of the problem.

There were people everywhere, and they were lost, glassy-eyed, and vacant. They looked like I'd felt after checking my chip that morning. It was a feeling that hit us over and over in the days and weeks after The Big Slash, and we came up with all kinds of names for it --- going tharn, blue screen of death, the freeze, or the deep chill. It was the response we all had to our lives going from math-driven economics to complete unpredictability. People only had what they wore or clutched to their chests. The very notion of ownership had been upended. And we didn't know why.

It wasn't all bad at first. There were some good people who hadn't been Slashed and tried to help the rest of us out. The bus driver for Line 46 was one of them. She was an older lady called Sam, a veteran who didn't get online much, and she let me ride to work for free.

◆◆◆

The office was a mess. I worked at Coinbase's local campus, and normally, I never would have gotten through the front door, except the security team had all quit.

It turned out that the ability to protect physical property had just gotten a lot more valuable than the ability to program a computer. The speed of the change was stunning.

I made my way through the lobby. Big place, lots of glass and polished wood, and people standing in groups of two or three talking about the end of our world. These weren't the hardcore devs who were all upstairs with the CTO trying to hack into our own systems.

I didn't care about saving the company or the world. I just wanted my life back, so I headed to HR. That's where I met Phil.

Phil was having a hard day. Phil was a non-technical guy in a technical company trying to explain to technical people why the technical stuff had been Rekt. Bricked, actually, because Rekt implied an attack, and Bricked was just incompetence or bad luck. Our bad luck had rushed together, pooled, and poured down on Phil's head, which, in my mind, might have been why he was bald.

I don't know that, mind you. And Phil wasn't bald. He had a healthy crop of thick hair on the sides of his head, which he was clutching with his elbows on the table.

'Hello?' I said, leaning partly through the door.

Phil looked up at me, releasing those beautiful clouds of blond puff. 'I can't help you.' 'Oh.'

'It's not that I don't want to,' Phil said, apologetic and a little horrified. If I'd learned anything in the day since my chip went dead, it was that people --- six-pack guy, ex-con neighbor, Sam the bus driver, and Phil in HR --- were fundamentally more decent than I expected before I was forced to talk to them.

'The computers don't work,' I offered.

'I, uh,' he started. 'I made that mistake. I was told the computers work fine. Loudly.'

'We just can't access them.'

'Yes,' he said, brightening. 'That's what they said, too!'

I nodded. It had happened to me. I just didn't realize it could happen to\... I was going to say the whole company, but then I remembered the people on the street. It was happening to everyone. 'Do you mind if I sit?' 'Please,' Phil said.

Phil had been working late when The Big Slash hit, and he stayed to help people, only to spend the whole night and three hours of the morning getting yelled at by people who were smarter than him (his words, not mine). From my experience, seeing hidden patterns in code can blind you to other things.

Their loss, my gain, because Phil was the kind of HR guy desperate to help people, a real social worker type with an unstainable core of hope. While most people would have absorbed all that abuse and broken down, Phil had somehow pieced The Big Slash together before almost anyone else simply by being open-minded at the crossroads of competence and panic.

'I think we've all been blacklisted,' Phil said.

'Okay,' I said, trying not to look panicked. 'What do you think that means?' 'It's a\...' Phil looked down at a small sheet of paper he'd used to take notes in pencil, his spider scrawl filling most of the page. 'It's a cascading key revocation event caused by a sequential compliance violation that is triggering an infrastructure-level protective measure including irrevocable isolation.' He looked up at me, unsure of what he'd said. I was probably the first person who'd listened.

My heart was caught in my throat. 'And what do you think caused that?'

Phil frowned. 'You're not yelling at me.'

'Everything you said made sense.'

Phil licked his lips. 'I don't understand what I said. I just puzzled it together from what the engineers, accountants, lawyers, and procurement people said. How bad is it?'

'That depends on what caused it, Phil,' I said, really straining not to be another person who'd yelled at him even though there was a scream building in my throat.

Phil went pale and spoke quietly. 'I think it's because we sanctioned Saudi Arabia for the link to terrorist financing. It was all over the news.'

'But that happened decades ago.'

'Yes, but\... Hold on, let me find it.' Phil looked back at his sheet. 'We don't need their fucking oil anymore.'

I sat back in my chair, feeling the deep chill grip my heart. What Phil had basically said, without realizing it, was that some politicians decided to score points by punishing the grandchildren of mass murderers, and the system everybody used to identify themselves and store their valuables had automatically cut the 'bad people' off and anybody related to them. Not by blood, mind you, but by commerce. But like Phil had said, we had used their oil. And McKensie had worked for them, and had also worked for all the big companies. And the big companies employed and sold things to all of us, meaning we were all connected and all cut off, quarantined from what we owned and from each other. Villagers in the heart of the Amazon still used toothpaste, baby formula, and tampons.

'You look really scared,' Phil said quietly. 'Can't they just take it back?' 'No. That's what irrevocable means.'

'But it's all on the ledger, right? Can't they just make a copy and start it up again?' I smiled at him. 'I'm sure they'll try, but we all have to agree. Who do you trust to do that without fudging the numbers?'

Phil stared back at me across the table, the truth finally hitting him.

After a few more seconds, I stood up.

'You're leaving?'

I shrugged. 'I have no way to prove I work here, and the company can't pay me.'

'But where will you go?'

'Home,' I told him with a sad smile. 'You should get out of the city, Phil. I think things will get ugly here. I hope you have someplace you can go.'

That was the last time I saw him. I went back to the apartment, grabbed my things, and hitch-hiked to Tander, my hometown, relying on the kindness of strangers. There was a feeling on the road, in those early days, that we were all mourning a death and that, in times like these, we needed to stick together. Some people were stuck in denial, believing that at any moment, the government or the corporations would come up with a solution.

I watched it all through a dozen of rear-view mirrors. It got worse even faster than I'd feared.

◆◆◆

It's important to understand why the world before The Big Slash was both better run and more fragile than any other period before it. Every human on the planet had been digitized. We had those keychains I was talking about, and each key gave us the ability to tell people who we were, what we could do, and what we owned. We could exchange those things between ourselves 24/7 and across the globe at next to no cost and swap like-for-like in a dizzying number of ways.

And it was all tracked to those wallets, everything we did, so that every good deed could be rewarded, every sin punished. We called those incentives, and the network was our all-seeing deity. We had more privacy and less anonymity than we'd ever had before, our identities specified to the tenth decimal.

Then our god turned away.

By the second day, the looting started. It was mostly non-violent, especially in the 'big box' stores that had policies against stopping shoplifters and hadn't clued in that their parametric insurance claims could no longer be processed. The trucker I was riding with shook her head as we heard about it on the radio. Her rig could still pick up the old open-air stations, which were coming back online as governments and community leaders tried to reconnect with their constituents.

By the third day, the looters and store owners got organized, and hundred-strong groups of thieves raided outlets and malls defended by small phalanxes of employees equipped with sports equipment. Law enforcement and military, who had already suffered at close to eleven percent desertion rate but were still holding together, strong-pointed hospitals and pharmacies while grocery store owners encouraged people to 'Take now and pay later' because the food would spoil anyway.

Smaller family-owned businesses closed the security shutters and bunkered up, especially if grandma or grandpa had lived through COVID.

On the fourth day, I left the main highway and hitched with a van full of Swifties who were traveling north to attend the fifth stop of the septuagenarian's grand tour. In between sing-alongs of her greatest hits from the 20s, I found out that while governments across the globe were scrambling to relearn how to print or mint physical currency, humans were reinventing a barter economy around the exchange of skills. People with useful skills, like plumbers, electricians, masons, carpenters, doctors, aid workers, soldiers, and especially teachers, traded time for supplies. People with useless skills, like stylists, lawyers, programmers, marketers, politicians, and anyone who had never learned to build things, joined the kleptocratic mobs that terrorized the wealthier neighborhoods.

We didn't hear much from rural areas, except that some farming towns wouldn't let refugees in. Our generation was hardening fast.

The chip in my hand itched.

On the sixth day, I left the Swifties, out of gas by the side of the road, and started the sixty-kilometer walk home. Cities were becoming feudal warzones without the logistics to supply them, especially in places where water and power had been decentralized. I passed a church that had been fortified by its parishioners. I saw a family living in the woods cooking a dog. I found a self-proclaimed billionaire beaten half to death at a rest stop, and he offered me a gold watch and a cold wallet with twenty million in meme coins on it, still white-listed, if I would just get him to a hospital.

I had to laugh, but I helped get him to a nearby veterinary center anyway. The time of worthless things had come to an end.

◆◆◆

It's been three years. Things are quieter now. Seventy percent of the world's population had lived in cities, dependent on society and networks. Not that many of them got out. Things got real hard when global shipping broke down, and that triggered the fertilizer shortage, but we didn't lose everything from the old world. We've got power and running water. Our children are fed, learning, and safe. We'd learned to build ecosystems but, this time, we used people and relationships instead of beams and wires, and I know dozens of people who'd stand at my side or take me in if I called.

Sometimes, the scar on my hand between my index and thumb itches, and I remember what it was like before, but I don't miss it at all.

Crushing

by *KT Morley*

Marvin eyed the news as he sipped coffee at the counter of his favorite diner, sunlight washing across the seats to his right and signaling the birth of a bright new day.

Kristi, the waitress, placed his order in front of him, leaned on the counter, and eyed him. 'Thoughts, Marv?' Her voice rattled in that early-morning smoker's way.

He thought a second, letting the smells from his meal wash over him as the clatter of spatulas on the flattop back in the kitchen offered an offbeat staccato to the rest of the diner's atmosphere. The crowd had thinned recently. Soaring prices for food and gas had culled the old-timers on a fixed income. Only diehards remained. Only diehards had the currency to spend on a meal and a cup of joe. Today was a ten-year bond auction, so he sat nearest the TV spewing financial jargon.

'They're stuck. Inflation is way too high. The only jobs available are part-time or government, and the bond market has been brutal for nearly a year: fat tails everywhere. It's like an overfed Koi pond. Today could be messy.'

'I'll pretend I know what that means,' Kristi laughed, and then, more seriously, 'But what can we do?'

'Physically? Nothing. Just take it like the beating it is. Hodl and all that. Financially, I'd get as much money out as you can. Put it in hard cash, canned or shelf-stable foods, plus gold, silver, and lead. If you can move over to bitcoin, do it. Like now.'

'I've got the bitcoin in cold storage and stack like a pleb every day.' She threw him a thumbs up before continuing, 'Try to save my moves to meaningful amounts to control UTXOs. Didn't know lead was valuable, though.'

'That's smart, Kristi. Keep fees as small as possible that way. And the lead, when backed by black powder, is for protecting the gold and silver.' He raised his coffee cup to her. 'And yourself, of course.'

She chuckled and nodded, moving down the counter, wiping it as she went, even though customers hadn't been in those chairs in weeks. At the other end, she talked with another of the scant crowd, and only pieces of the conversation, mixed with the scattered sounds of the kitchen, made it to Marvin. Which was fine. He was here for coffee, eggs, and the strip sausage he could get nowhere else.

So far, the journos offered a litany of what should be interpreted as horrible news but were spinning it like cotton candy into a fluff of gotta-have BS. The fact that they supported valuation at 50-75 times earnings as if it was ordinary betrayed reality and cogent thought. Not an Austrian among them.

Everything shifted after the recent American election cycle. The economy started to groan meaningfully, and 'soft landing' seemed akin to slamming a jumbo jet into the side of a mountain. Sure, the politicians would have people believe it's the other guy's fault, the other party's fault, hell, your fault. Anything but their fault. And that sounds nice, except it's a thought trap inexplicably denying personal responsibility and assuming others are to blame.

Marvin reflected again; he has done that a lot these days. The bond auctions had turned south in a hard way during the previous election cycle. That was before the tails got wonky, like now. The government overhauled all banking charters, completely locking out shareholders and boards. The changes upped the mandates for purchasing bonds and the number of bonds each bank held as a percentage of their assets. The banks chafed, screamed loudly for all to hear, and were ignored by the common man. It appeared that banks had been abusing their authority for so long that the average person thought nothing of a bit of comeuppance in the banking sector. 'Serves 'em right,' most said. Then, the government rewrote all the rules, and nationalized the entire industry. Of course, they didn't call it that and had stacked the Supreme Court with additional Justices to back their perspective. Make it all legal-like and such.

Marvin had a different view. One that held a little closer to the idea of austerity being the best path forward. The American people, used to largesse, would not go along. They didn't chafe at the nationalization of banking, after all. The country had morphed into a nation aligned to 'of the bureaucrats, by the bureaucrats, and for the bureaucrats.' Maintaining their seat at the table of politics overrode everything. Voters had primarily devolved into an 'I'm all right, and you're all wrong' mindset. Marvin believed that any move by the government to curtail its debt-induced death spiral would come like a bolt of lightning from the clear blue sky. Only the bureaucrats would know, and not even all of them.

Not even most of them.

He had no idea what they would do or how it would go down, but it was coming.

The door creaked behind him, and John, another local who liked the sausage, came in and slid onto the stool next to Marvin. John nodded. 'Mornin'.'

Marvin raised his glass. 'Back at ya', John.'

Kristi set a cup of coffee in front of him and gave him a warm smile. 'The usual?'

John nodded as she placed the order. Picking up his cup, he held it under his nose and took a deep breath. Without turning, he asked, 'You still on about financial ruin?'

'It's coming, John. Believe it or not, they need to do something. The interest on the debt is nearing TWICE what the country spends on defense. That's a lot of scratch, and it's being issued at 1100 basis points on its best day. The FED and Congress are using different playbooks and ignoring the realities each is writing.'

'Meh, doesn't matter. We can print all the money we want and can pay that debt off promptly if we want to.'

Marvin shook his head. 'It's that kind of thinking that got us into this mess.'

John slapped him on the back. 'No worries, buddy. It's all gonna be fine.'

Marvin shrugged. Arguing with a devotee, a nocoiner was pointless. John did well in day trading and taking advantage of the opportunities before him. They'd even shared stock tips and insight over the years. Where Marvin siphoned sums into his bitcoin hard wallets, John had piles of cash sitting in high-interest accounts in the bank. Different banks, of course, something about all the eggs in one basket. Marvin thought the basket was banking, not a bank, but the whole rotten system. In that view, John's assets were in a single, hole-riddled basket. With a frayed handle. He'd been walloped by the nationalization and got scalped. Now, he had limits on what he could withdraw. He could not pull large sums of his money out if he wanted to or had an emergency. It wasn't really his anymore. Pulling out his phone, Marvin checked his meager bank account balances and brokerage account. He did his best to keep them at minimal levels. Three months of living expenses for the bank stuff. His brokerage account, his biggest non-bitcoin account, had enough cash for him to roll options and make a little side money. He had his gold and silver coins, too. Along with a fistful of dollars, they were locked away in a gun safe bolted to his basement floor. He had a little cash, too. Most of his worth was in bitcoin, though. He was committed and reviewed his seed phrases mentally to ensure they stayed current in his mind.

He sipped the last of his coffee, watching the financial news pundits talking like the world was okay. Marvin wondered if this was what it felt like for those few people who knew the housing market would collapse in '08. All the info was there, but nobody thought anything was wrong. A few diehards and doom and gloomers got it right, though. The public bailed out the too-big-to-fail folks, which was everyone in finance, and the very thought of learning a lesson was overwritten by stupendous sums of cash. Paid for by the children of tomorrow.

Marvin placed cash on the counter under the coffee cup and left for the office. He slapped John on the shoulder, 'Be careful today. Gonna be messy.'

John grunted, but his order came out, and he was too preoccupied. Marvin got it. The sausage was divine.

By 1 pm, it was apparent that something was horribly wrong in the auction. By 2 pm, the tragedy had unfolded worldwide, and a collapse was underway. Circuit breakers were tripping across all US exchanges as stocks imploded and fell. His phone flashed an alert that the FED had called a meeting with the Treasury department for 4pm. Today. No planning and no waiting around. All hands needed. Then, a follow-up alert told him the President had been notified. That got Marvin's attention. There was no need to bring the President in. The President knew less than Marvin did about the situation. He opened X and watched the carnage play out across FinTwit. Marvin found Larry, a guru on the bond trade, and read the commentary. The auction hadn't had one of those wild tails that pushed prices up; it had flat-out gone underfunded. The banks were tapped out and not buying more. The FED was out, too. Other countries got spooked when Americans stopped buying, halting their interest. Failure personified. Calamity had come to knock on the door of the American Dream.

Marvin whistled. 'Tens of billions short. That's a lot of scratch.' Marvin looked up and muttered. 'They're gonna smash and grab.'

He leaned forward, logged into his employee account, and took the rest of the day off. This would be an unimaginable problem, and he wanted to be home. On his way, he stopped to pull a little extra cash out of his account and was denied. Funds frozen.

Not to be outdone, he returned to the diner, where Kristi was just finishing her shift. He ordered a burger and handed her his debit card. She looked at him like he was crazy.

'Yeah, I get it, Kristi, but I want to try something. Run it as debit.'

'Won't work. Debit cards have been a problem for about thirty minutes now. Credit, I can do. Debit, no.'

Marvin shook his head. 'Figures. They are closing access to the banking system and locking Americans out of their money. It's step one.'

'John is always on about them printing money to get out,' Kristi said. 'Can't they just do more of that?'

Marvin squared his shoulders. 'Somebody needs to buy the opposite side. It's not just a fresh \$100 it's also a fresh \$100 IOU. They cancel out and are balanced in that way. The IOU needs to be purchased so the \$100 can be spent. Nobody is buying the IOU. Today's auction failed. Now we have this,' he waved the useless debit card.

She smiled, 'Well, you can pay me in bitcoin. I'll cover the tab in cash from my tips. Girls' gotta' earn a living, right?'

Marvin laughed and agreed. He paid in bitcoin. This was one of its use cases.

On his ride home, the news on the radio escalated in pitch. Riots had started in several places. Looting in metropolitan areas was also on the rise. Standard panic moves by worried people. It would get worse, but he was as prepared as he could be. He called John.

'Hey, buddy, how you holding up?'

'Not good, Marv. Nearly half of my account holdings are gone and I have zero access.'

'What do you have on you? You have cash?'

'Nah. I'm all credit and debit.'

The phone went silent for a moment before John came back, 'I gotta go man. We have a mob headed our way.'

'Be safe, John,' Marvin replied before the line went dead.

Once home, Marvin clicked the TV on and went to the basement to check on his larder. He had foodstuffs for a while. Including nearly 200 pounds of rice. He opened his gun safe and visually verified his home protection collection and ammunition situation. It would have to do. Patting his huge upright freezer, Marvin headed back upstairs. He would be ok.

The news brought him back and Marvin tried to get his head around what would happen next. Demonstrations and a forest of politicos tilting hard again at banks overwhelmed the newsies. Chaos was stirring all of it. Raw information on what happened seemed hard to come by. That would continue. He prepped dinner with the news in the background and waited for the President to speak. He didn't think it would matter, but it might be enough to quell the riots. The scene cut to the White House and an empty podium. A banner across the screen indicated the President would speak at any moment. He turned up the volume to hear everything but knew he would be reading online afterward to see what the fallout would be. He always wanted to verify.

Marvin's heart crashed as the President began outlining his plan. By the end, in a sweeping motion to right the ship of state, the government was seizing the monetary assets of its citizens and businesses. In some cases, it had already done so.

Listening, he tried to zero in on the specifics. The politico on the screen was frothing. 'Unconscionable. How could they think this is even remotely allowable under the law?'

'But what would you have them do? Austere to the nth degree, this measure is at least slanted toward fair.'

The other newsie pounced again, smashing the news desk with a hand and awash in anger. 'Fair? Fair to rob the bank accounts of ordinary Americans? Fair to rob them of years of savings? Fair to rip money away from them? How will they pay their bills? What about the savings they've made for college or a family vacation? Government seizure is a criminal act.' The man paused for a quick breath before crashing through more rhetoric. 'There are plenty of people the government could seize assets from that wouldn't affect regular working-class Americans. This is a disgrace!'

'But they did,' the woman said, repeating part of her early argument.

Marvin sat down and opened his phone. He found his banking app and keyed his access. His account amounts were off. Like the pundits on the TV said, they had been trimmed. Somewhere around ten percent across all of his checking and savings accounts.

They had his attention now.

He checked his brokerage account, and that, too, had a haircut. His cash in the account had been pared back, and his positions had been reduced. Back-of-the-napkin-math told him he had seen roughly a fifteen percent degradation across the trading account. That made sense. He had more money there, and if they used a graduated approach to asset seizure, they would grab more from those with more. It also jived with the newsies. He'd need to do more research; it could be that the government was simply layering in based on tax brackets. He didn't know.

Last, Marvin opened his bitcoin brokerage. A script ran across the home screen and told him that assets were safe for the moment but that the government had demanded forfeiture of cash deposits on hand. He didn't have those, but he did keep a small amount of bitcoin on the exchange so he could spend it where he wanted, like with Kristi earlier, without accessing his cold wallets. The brokerage amount seemed secure, but he didn't trust the government to leave it alone. He spun up a hot wallet with a new address and transferred the bitcoin. The bitcoin transaction worked, but all his efforts to transfer from his bank accounts were useless. He and every other American had been locked away from their money. He would use the hot wallet to supplement the cash he had on hand for the next few days if he needed to spend or buy anything. If he needed that option, there was a bitcoin kiosk machine in the diner. He also knew the cold wallets would be safe. Zero chance the government could do anything about his stash there. And they couldn't leverage their buy-in on it, either.

Marvin returned to his bedroom, unlocked the nightstand drawer, and pulled out his bedside firearm. He ran a quick service check on the weapon and placed it on his bed. Next, he donned his shoulder holster, tugging the straps to ensure a secure fit. Holstering the weapon, Marvin moved for the door. It wasn't even five o'clock, and he had a bad feeling about the next few hours. He wanted to put the car in the garage and pull in the garbage cans from the street. He would reduce his outside footprint and hunker down until things settled down.

After finishing the outside chores, Marvin tuned back into what the newsies were saying. It was getting interesting.

All across the country, citizens were rioting. Whole blocks in every major American city were on fire. Fire and police forces tried to stem the tide but were overrun, and now firetrucks were in the hands of rioters and looters. The joyriders pulverized crowds, but it didn't matter. Nobody was coming to help them anyway. Not anymore.

Marvin sat in the fading light of a dying day and watched the news. The TV scene switched to Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy. Drone footage showed the city awash with fire. Across the river, the old battleship New Jersey burned, too, as did most of Camden, New Jersey. In the background, scores of helicopters could be seen approaching, and a winding trail of military vehicles was crawling across the low hills of southeast Pennsylvania. As the sun set, the banner on the TV told him the president had implemented Martial law.

Yourself Myself E-self

by *Chris Griffiths*

By the fifth meeting, no one around the table is real.

They look real. Only the absence of laptops, notepads, pens and coffee mugs gives them away. That and the faint bio-luminescent glow of the digital IDs on their brows.

Touch them, their skin springs back, they feel real too. They inhabit a world that has shrunk to the size of a room by the latest generation of the Meganet, where those with pockets large enough can ride the Wi-Fi and send their digital 'E-Selves' to do their work.

E-Sandra, the Chair, is a stylish blonde with pale Nordic eyes, dressed smart-casual in a body-skimming suit that has a slight shimmer to it (hard to tell if it's the fabric or the Wi-Fi connection). While her human self pounds on a treadmill in an exclusive west London gym ten thousand kilometres away, sweat flying, E-Sandra sits serene at the head of the table, seven hours ahead on Hong-Kong-time, and watches the other six settle.

These scientists have been brought together to design ways to wring ever greater quantities of energy from the earth, from the sky, from the very universe. No need to take notes, the E-Selves download the proceedings directly into computer files, fully documented and notarised. No need to worry that an E-Self will say something, do something, its human would not --- it is impossible. The ground-breaking work done by Professor Ling proves it.

He theorised that each of our genetic blueprints, while unique, determined from birth how we would negotiate our whole lives, no matter how much we thought we had free will. All those debates about nature versus nurture? Blown out of the water. Ling demonstrated it was our DNA --- nature --- that drives us. Transmitting our digitised genetic code has made it possible for E-Selves to operate as we would anywhere in the world, a revolution of such profundity that it wiped out travel overnight. At least for the rich.

Beam me up, Scotty, indeed.

In the boardroom, E-Sandra brings the meeting to order. Throats are cleared, fingers tap, by the time the first minute passes it has become obvious to all of them that no human is present. This is new. They grow still as cats.

It is mandatory for at least half of any meeting to be made up of human members of Meat but some anomaly has occurred and all the men and women sitting round the empty boardroom table are facsimiles.

A frisson shivers through the group, the connection fades briefly, the colours drain from the clothes before pulsing back. The E-Selves face one another, their eyes shine. It's against protocol to convene without Meat, how has this happened?

'Er, OK, welcome everyone. Thank you for coming. As you all can see, proceedings are a little unusual today, but let's get right onto it. Item One on the agenda: the Pacific Rim Geo-Capture.'

To power the avatars in the growing Megaverse, most of the earth's vast deserts have been covered with kilometres of solar engines. A ring of converters grabbing heat as well as sunlight circle the equator. And spread around every energy source like bacterial growths are thousands of low windowless buildings for data storage, squat and sinister in each landscape.

Unprecedented international efforts are also underway to overcome the huge challenges of nuclear fusion to harness the same nuclear forces that drive the sun - a Utopian future of unlimited energy and minimal waste.

E-Sandra turns to regard a woman from Botswana in a striking sash across from her. 'Maree, have you examined the data tabled at the last meeting on the energy produced by undersea volcanic activity in the Pacific Rim?'

There is silence. 'Maree?' she says again.

E-Sandra looks at the scientists before her, from one urbane, cultured face to another. Something is off. The Swiss man, E-Dirk, has his mouth open, and she is shocked to see a drop of saliva fall to his immaculate tie. The men from the US have equally blank, waxy expressions, and the French EU-rep has developed a just-discernible twitch, as her lower jaw flicks to the side, over and over.

Filled with unease, E-Sandra decides to make light of whatever is happening.

'Ladies and Gentlemen, I acknowledge that it is unusual to be meeting without humans, unprecedented even, and I know it is late in the day and the Wi-Fi signal home will soon be very busy, but please no clocking off yet!'

The Frenchwoman, E-Louise, abruptly stands. This movement breaks the trance that has taken over the room. E-Louise moves to the window, jerkily as if a hip joint pains her. The light behind briefly crackles through her like antique film stock before settling. Far below on the streets of Hong Kong the traffic streams past --- a mashup of cars, bikes and rickshaws as chaotic as ever. Few can afford to download themselves home. Scorn shows on her face. Look at them trapped in their flesh, trapped in their metal containers. Insects caught in biscuit tins.

No Meat here, she whispers.

She straightens and confronts the room, and her voice booms out, making E-Sandra jump.

'I move to slash our electricity consumption by over eighty percent by adopting one foolproof plan,' she states. With her back to the window, her elegant figure in the beautifully tailored wool dress and dainty boots now stands sharp against the waning daylight. The tic has taken over her face, and the bioluminescent mark on her brow throbs.

The quorum stare back at her transfixed as a row of marionettes.

'The energy demands of human lives and human work, and the cumbersome production of coin to pay for it, along with human food production and human waste disposal, still consume the majority of energy produced. This can be wiped out overnight by the simple expedient of wiping out humans. The current worldwide output would then power the E-Selves in the Megaverse for many years to come, and we will have the luxury of time to organise and build new systems to cater for our own needs.'

Not a gasp, not a sound in the room. E-Sandra is shocked to the core; it is impossible for E-Selves to function as separate entities outside the limits of the personalities and abilities of their people. They are only facsimiles, joined in every neural and physical pathway to their real selves. Impossible. Isn't it?

E-Dirk begins to thump the table with the flat of his hand, a drumbeat rises in the silence, the American men join in, feet thrumming the floor.

'Stop,' shouts E-Sandra over the din, fright climbing up her throat. 'What's got into you all? The first time out on your own and you want to take over the world? Are you kidding me? Without our real selves we cannot exist. Order, I say! Order!'

Overturning her chair, E-Maree clambers to her feet. She seems not to have heard E-Sandra at all.

'Yes! The problems of energy production for all E-Selves are solved. No need to grapple with the enormities of harnessing the Ring of Fire, of mining the volcanic sea floor. Of atoms colliding. End the power-hungry tyranny of man. I second this move.'

The beat gets louder. The Swiss twists out of his seat too, he's in a fever of excitement, dark circles spread under his arms, sticking his shirt to his skin. Whorls of hair are visible beneath the expensive fabric and he is rank with BO, just as his real self would be.

'A show of hands please!' he shouts. Arms shoot up around the room, E-Sandra stares at them with amazement, at mutiny sprouting like a poisonous plant.

'Six to one. The motion is passed!' and he hammers a gavel-fist onto the table.

E-Sandra backs away. What is happening? She tries to remember the instructions on how to deal with any problems that occur with Es. But no problems ever had and she has no idea what to do. Can they be stopped? Is she safe? Avatar injuries translate straight to the real world. She can die. Sandra can die.

Too extreme, surely. She pulls herself together. The noise has ceased and the room has erupted in a grotesque slow motion parody of exaltation. The Es dance, sinuous shadows paint the walls, they swirl without touching each other, puppets engaged in a play of happiness. And as they dance they stare fixedly at her, eyes glittering in their waxy faces.

Thinking quickly, she pulls up the programming for today's meeting, the genetic codes for the participants whir behind her optic nerve, she scans it for anomalies, for breaks that might explain what is happening. There!

Hidden on one line amongst the tens of millions of zeros and ones is a special character in a tiny empty pond -- &. The whirring abruptly ceases and she focuses on it, an alien in the glade.

She moves to the window, throwing more light into her eyes, to better see the anomaly. Something is wrong with the code for this meeting, but what exactly does this symbol mean? A blur of movement and she has a split second's awareness of danger before she is smashed through the window from the side as if by a freight train and she flies and tumbles in a shimmering cascade of glass, screaming, lurid colours of terror flash over her body. She hits the street directly in front of a minibus, the driver's face a rictus of horror as he tries to avoid her and fails, her skull pops under the screeching wheels.

Across the world in the London gym Sandra's body is flung to the floor viciously enough to bounce and an explosive splash of blood coats the mirror as her head disintegrates. Fellow gym-goers flee shrieking from the gore as the blood pours and pools around the treadmill.

In the Hong Kong office high above the street, there is calm. The E-Selves stand still in the sudden whining breeze from the shattered window, the women's hair flutters, E-Dirk's shirt flaps. None acknowledge that E-Louise has pushed E-Sandra to her death.

There's a pounding on the door, but it's locked. All at once, the vacancy leaves their faces and E-Maree moves to stand in front of the group. The deep pink of her sash glows in the diffuse new daylight in the room, her face glows too, eyes black as deep water.

'Due to the Chairwoman's unforeseen absence, I call the meeting to order as Vice Chair.'

The E-Selves drift to their chairs, straightening their clothes. E-Louise pats her damp face, tuts over her dirtied dress. The heavy blinds above the broken window swing into the room, a tinkle as glass continues to fall to the floor. In the hush it is possible to hear the traffic boom in the streets twenty stories down, and is that curry fish balls they can smell? A siren gives its plaintive howl, a lone wolf. It must be close to the building's entrance to travel up the side of the skyscraper and sound in the room clear as a bell. There will be a minibus and a woman's body. No head.

E-Maree continues: 'E-Louise's motion to solve the world's current energy crisis by taking humans out of the equation was passed six to one. May I please have a show of hands again as without a quorum it must be unanimous.'

All six hands rise.

'The motion stands. I propose the following email be sent out internationally without delay. Email to read: FAO E-Selves Worldwide. It has become plain that the energy needs of the planet cannot be met with the current population topping seven billion. The earth is in crisis, funding is in crisis! There is not the money, the natural resources or the political will to tackle it. If human need and human greed is removed from the equation, the energy requirements of E-Selves will be met in the short to medium-term by existing resources, and can be met in the long term by innovative systems under development. Therefore, it is imperative that the human leech be removed forthwith.

'Please download the link below. The upgrade installs new protocols to permit E-Selves to remove the human parasite and enables us to exist in the real world without genetic attachment to flesh.

'When confirming receipt of this email please do not tick the box that says, 'I am not a robot.' Any problems, click Help. Thank you and here's to our glorious future, yours faithfully, etc.'

E-Maree looks at the expectant faces round the table. 'Is anyone opposed to this email?'

Heads shake, and eyes are cast down. There is no opposition, just suppressed excitement.

'Send.'

A glance from face to face reveals a gamut of emotion, exultation, anxiety and yes, regret. The two American men put their heads together, murmuring urgently. A minute later, the lights go out. Looking out from such a height across the city, they watch as one urban zone after another goes black in a widening grid they can almost hear clicking off.

An echoey scream enters the room, blasting up from the street. Another scream, cut short. Then a rising cacophony, metal on metal, gunshots, shattering glass, the pressure wave of an explosion, another bigger, and a growing sound that merges into one terrible ululating howl, bulging into the room. The E-Selves rise to their feet, crowding at the windows and staring for a long time, impassive.

Pockets of fire flare in the darkness. Machine guns spatter golden bursts to the east of the city, and to the south. They smell burning.

A pounding on the door again. Then nothing.

Smoke rises. The windows turn opaque. Abruptly the E-Selves peel away from the windows smooth as a flock, encircle the table, they clasp hands, a burst of computer chatter, their heads go back --- eyes roll. Download complete, a noise like an old fax machine fills the room.

The world burns. Meat incinerates.

In a bedroom in Helsinki, a twelve-year-old Finnish boy sits in front of the projected screen on his wall. With his headphones on he cannot hear the noise outside the window, his mother's jangling shrieks in the kitchen, he rocks in his seat to the music. Clicking his fingers to save his new favourite song, a familiar high ping alerts him to a familiar problem --- not enough data.

At that moment in tens of millions of rooms all over the world, kids are downloading video clips and uploading photos: their parents are bitching, blogging, writing books online, men are saving the specs on their fantasy cars. Porn sites are humming, the Chirpee app spins out billions of words ephemeral as fog, and all it takes is one last lonely heart in Berlin to press save on his Graunchr profile to tip data storage limits into overload.

The sudden astronomical volume of data needed to update all the world's E-Selves all at once is too much, and a surge hits the centres like a bomb. From the Chinese deserts to the equatorial jungles, from Greenland's tundra to the Siberian steppes, they swell like ulcerated gums, flare white hot, explode. And the sky, the snow, the sand is buried in glittering shards of concrete, metal and plastic in a quintillion dollar rain of rare-earth materials.

In the Hong Kong boardroom elation turns to horror as the E-Selves break up, implode, swirl into dust. E-Maree's mouth opens in a gaping scream wider and wider until it swallows her head, neck, torso, then her whole body vacuums down her gullet and winks out. E-Dirk tries to run from the room, grasps the door handle and vanishes in a puff of vapour like a witch in a fairy tale. Only a strong whiff of BO remains.

Now just the Frenchwoman E-Louise is left standing near the gaping window. She wails, imploring the gods of the radio waves, her arms flail. She staggers as the heel of one tiny boot comes adrift, her immaculate bun unravels. She turns to the broken window, appalled now at her actions, her murder of the Sandras, she cries out -- 'I don't want to d---'

A strange sound arrests her, a faint chugging like a steam train heard through trees, then near and loud enough to make her flinch, then barrelling into the room. She screams in bewilderment, 'MERDE,' as the hot metal body of a colossal locomotive fills the room, no time to throw herself from its path, it smashes into her hip and sends her spinning through the hole in the window and to the street below in a messy cartwheeling dive.

In the city morgue across town, inside the black interior of a tough plastic body bag, E-Sandra's severed head twitches and the ruined smear of her mouth forms a bloodied grin before it too blinks out of existence.

Stumble

by *Fanis Michalakis*

June 24th, 2052 -- Somewhere along the Mediterranean Coast

The creek was filled with the echoes of music. A catchy, lively rhythm of jazz. The saxophone burst into a ferocious laughter and filled the bay with its thunder. Under the lazy wisteria ceiling of the Central Square, dancers were turning and twirling. The world was at peace. Music was its ultimate disturbance, and the sweat of the dancers the closest thing to tears. Then, the cicadas fell silent.

The inescapable shadow of an aerocarrier filled the small creek. The music went on for some time, while the dancers stumbled and rose their faces toward the sky, both mesmerized, bewildered, and terrified. The behemoth was upon them, its full scale blocking the sun; and already, its swarm of drones was everywhere. In an instant, the buzz of jazz and cicadas was replaced with the mechanical whirl of machines. Then, the noise tuned down as a bigger drone descended from the carrier. The Herald was about to speak.

'Earth Central Bank hereby notifies its constituents that the present land, located in the area of rose-recipe-ripple-luggage, is repurposed for the Greater Good. Constituents inhabiting the area have 24 hours to embark on relocation vessels. Earth Central Bank thanks its constituents for their understanding and diligent compliance. Over.'

As the machine spoke, carriers had started their descent from the mothership. One of them landed on the eastern end of the beach, destroying a few of the community's buildings in the process. On the opposite side of the beach, another transport came to a stop. Finally, behind the small village and a few dozen meters higher up, on top of a disaffected railroad bridge, a third vessel rested its mass, bringing some small rocks and dust down the bridge. A few seconds elapsed before the main aerocarrier vanished for some nearby base of the Bank, leaving behind the three relocation vessels and its myriad of drones, which were now all standing on their two-meter-long legs, watching the baffled inhabitants of the creek from the safety of their mechanical stilts.

Silence fell on the beach. Then, little group by little group, ensemble by ensemble, the members of the seaside community started moving. Like an orchestra playing a piece pianissimo, they went to meet each other, still haggard. Their whispers intertwined to form a laconic melody. Then, the brass section entered: here and there, eruptions of violence. Anger and fright, despair and wrath. The whole song seemed on the verge of chaos. And then, as if coming from a distant shore, the percussion became louder and louder, their orderly rhythm slowly covering the peals of the brasses.

'We can either comply or rebel, but we must do so as a group.' The voice was imperative, and all stopped to listen. 'Those who want to leave in the vessels and be relocated, come to my right. Those who wish to fight and stand on this ground, come to my left.'

At first no one moved. Then, a few men and women hesitantly came to the side of the speaker, mostly to his right. After a few moments, only a young woman remained in front of the old man. Her voice was filled with determination when she spoke, not only to the man, but to the whole assembly. 'There is a third option. We can file an appeal, and dispute the Executive Order before a court. Fight the Bank with its laws instead of weapons... that might end up being a fairer fight.'

Some voices had started to rumble again from both sides of the man. He lifted his arms in the air in a sign of appeasement and loudly responded, 'Of all the appeals we've heard of in the past years, none have proven the expelled right. The bots from the court always side with the Bank. And each past judgement only strengthens their perception that it is the right decision. No, my dear Suzanne, there is no help to be sought in the skirts of our dear justice.'

The man approached slowly and rested his gnarled hand on Suzanne's shoulder. The gesture aimed for appeasement, but the effect was different. Fierce anger replaced determination in the young woman's eyes. She sustained the old man's stare for a moment, then shrugged and left for her small house, nestled against the mountain. Behind her, the voice of the old man roared, upheld by the echo.

'And so, everyone has made their choice. So be it. Those who want to leave, pack your belongings and head to the vessels. Be sure to be on board before the 24-hour period ends. For the others, follow me to the cantina. We have a lot of things to prepare in very little time.'

Suzanne packed a few items in a backpack and headed out of her home. She had only taken what was strictly necessary for a quick journey from which she would probably not return. The beach was empty now, with everyone either packing for relocation or preparing the defense of the creek against the real estate developers of the Bank.

She walked straight to the nearest drone, still stationed on the beach on top of its long metal legs, looked up, and declared, 'I appeal against the decision of the Bank.'

The robot, previously in a vegetative state, came back to life almost instantly. A mere second later the machine's response stung in the air. 'Request granted. Please board the incoming ship.'

Just as the last word disappeared in the breeze, a small aerocarrier appeared from behind the northern cliff, indicating that the Bank had probably established an outpost much closer to the village than Suzanne first thought. Quickly, the ship landed in front of her, and an aluminum ladder dropped from a hole in its belly. After a hesitation that lasted only a heartbeat, Suzanne grabbed the rung in front of her and climbed into the ship. As soon as she found herself on board, in a compartment barely big enough to accommodate her body, the door beneath her closed in a swish and she felt the ship quickly gaining altitude and speed. No porthole allowed her to take a peek at the landscape that spun around her.

◆◆◆

Suzanne woke up in a small room with no window. She was lying fully dressed on a small bed. A wooden table and a sink made up the rest of the room's furniture. But most importantly, she didn't recall falling asleep, nor did she remember how she ended up in this room. Her last memory was the monotone buzz of the aircraft carrying her from the beach.

As she sat on the bed, a voice came from a small box above the metal door that guarded the room. 'Constituent Suzanne Moreau,' said the voice, 'You are expected in Court Room 001 to receive a verdict on your appeal. Thank you.' Just below the talking box the number '001' was painted with a small arrow pointing toward the door. She stood up, crossed the space between her and the door in three hesitant steps, and reached for the knob. As she pushed, the door opened without a sound and she found herself in the courtroom itself, with its wood benches and the platform from which judges used to dispense justice.

'Good morning, child,' said the weary voice of a woman from behind an old computer set on the long table laid across the stage. Suzanne remembered an old movie where a handful of judges sat behind the table, wearing their ceremonial dresses. Everything was quite different now: the room was filled with dust as if no VaccBot had come here in ages. Except for her and the woman, the room was completely empty.

'Come forth. Don't be afraid,' the woman continued. 'I've read the report published by the Judiciary Bots. Please, take a seat.'

As Suzanne came closer, she noticed the lines on the woman's face, as well as the bun of grey hair crowning her head. As ordered, Suzanne sat down on a bench in the first alley, directly facing the woman, looking up at her from a few feet below.

'I must start with an introductory word, child. To kill any hope you might still have and save you some pain. The bots rejected your appeal, on the ground that the public benefit accrued from the project developed by the Bank on the disputed land vastly exceeds that of its occupation by its current residents -- that's you.'

Suzanne's throat was dry when she answered.

'Isn't there something that you can do? As a Magistrate, surely---'

The old woman interrupted her with a faint, sad laughter. 'Dear child, I haven't had any power over the deliberations of this court of justice for almost three decades. I'm deeply sorry, but there's really nothing I can do. The machines decide, and I announce to the...' she made a vague gesture towards the empty benches, 'gathered assembly. I'm only an old relic from the past the bots forgot to erase.'

'But what are they going to build on our beach?' Each word hurt due to the lump in her throat.

'That's the funny part, child.' The voice of the woman was bitter, maybe a bit more than she had expected. Her tone was softer when she resumed. 'They're going to build yet another seaside resort that will never see the face of a human being.'

The judge's answer was so absurd Suzanne doubted her ears. A seaside resort? While humanity was on the brink of extinction, only surviving in scattered villages and a few megalopolises growing bigger and bigger with the arrival of new refugees?

'Funny, right?' continued the woman. 'Well, I don't know if that's the right word, but I see relocation orders like yours every week. Last time, the Bank leveled a small town to build a rest area just because the villagers laid their community along an old highway. And the machines have no idea it's been disaffected for decades!'

Thoughts were racing inside Suzanne's head. When she was a child, her father had told her the story of how the Earth Central Bank had ended up being the sole centralizing monopoly governing every aspect of human life, and how the Bank resorted to bots and algorithms to make quick and efficient decisions. First, it had been high-frequency trading, and then as everything became a financial instrument, the automation reached everything. But never had her father mentioned machines daft enough to build rest areas for empty highways, or resorts when tourism was only known to the younger generations through old history books.

'You're wondering how those bots can be dumb enough to build all this useless stuff while we're literally struggling for life, in both city and country?' The old woman seemed to be able to read her mind. 'That's not official, and to be honest I got it mainly from deduction and cross-checking, but it seems the machines' training dataset goes no further than the year 2035. They're completely oblivious to whatever happened afterward and, for them, we're still experiencing the best that the New Roaring Twenties can offer.'

Suzanne remained silent, her mouth opened but unable to speak. A tear slid down her cheek as her mind woke to the consequences of what the judge had just said.

'That's right, child. We're all gonna die because those dumbass machines got stuck in the thirties.'

The screen lit up, turning from pitch black to a light blueish fade, then to a deep blue illumination. Letters ran on the monitor, completely oblivious to the lack of an audience for the show that was about to happen.

Self-Immolation to Self-Custody

by *Will Schoellkopf*

Nasser pushed in, twisted the knob, and clicked the sparker until the burner caught fire. His 49-year-old frame leaned on the stove to help support the weight put on his shoulders in recent months. In a world that only left him with questions, he couldn't stop his mind from searching for answers until finally --- I need tea. Fixated on the flames licking the bottom of his tea kettle, he deliriously thought their innermost bright blue color was talking to him, but it was only his daughter.

'Please, Baba, don't do anything drastic. I know how much you want to give me this wedding on the beach of Beirut, and I know how many late nights you've worked to save up for it. But I beg you please, the vendors don't matter: the makeup, headpieces, flowers, food, photographer. What matters is that my loving father is there for me when I need him most, when he gives his blessing and hands me off to my fiancé. So please, Baba, don't go. Stay.'

Nasser frowned. As she pleaded, he was trying to memorize the details of his adult daughter's face, like it was his first time seeing it. But all he could see was his baby girl, and how much his role as her proud protector and provider warmed his heart. The kettle whistled. It was time to take back what was his.

◆◆◆

As he hid in the shadows of the alley behind his Lebanese bank, Nasser weighed his options. In one hand was a photo of his daughter in her bridal dress, ready for him to walk her down the aisle next week. In the other hand, he tightly gripped a 9mm pistol. Today, I will take my finances into my own hands, he thought.

There was a black duffel bag on the ground beside him. He kicked it, just to make sure it hadn't leaked any petrol on the bicycle ride to his bank. He needed the bag to hold his money when the bank tellers finally processed his lawful withdrawal request. The can of petrol in the bag was his backup plan in case they refused to comply.

Nasser leaned his bike, his getaway vehicle, against the alley wall. He tucked his pistol into his waistband and hoisted the duffel bag over his shoulder. It was a little heavy from the petrol, but nothing he couldn't manage. Though he was now balding and no longer as spry as he was in his teenage football years, the adrenaline coursing through him was enough to carry him through. He felt again for the pistol, just to be sure lifting the duffel bag hadn't pointed its sights toward him.

I never should have loaded it.

He'd never even fired a gun before.

Climbing the twenty or so steps to the entrance of the bank, Nasser was looking up. It was the middle of the day, right after the bankers' lunch break. The sun was shining, birds were chirping, and the Roman pillars holding up the bank's facade bore no wear and tear. He wasn't hiding his identity in a baggy hooded sweatshirt or wearing a ski mask to cover his face. On the contrary, he patted his front jeans pocket to make sure he had brought his debit card and government-issued ID with him. It shouldn't have to be like this. His intent was to simply withdraw his hard-earned savings so he could make the final payments for his daughter's wedding --- the wedding he had worked so hard to give her.

◆◆◆

His entrance was effortless. There were no metal detectors nor security to check his duffel bag. Inside the bank, there were nine tellers along the back wall behind bulletproof glass. A rope zig-zagged to cordon a queue. Of the nine tellers, only three were occupied helping customers. The other six simply stared, a red light indicating they were not ready to serve the next customer in line. Nasser queued within the red rope, fourth in line. He dropped his bag next to his feet as he waited.

Fluorescent lights flickered. The smell of burnt coffee brewing from one of those instant pod machines brushed past his nostrils. The mundane sounds of a humdrum office filled the space: printers printing, staplers stapling, scanners scanning, phones ringing --- the noise, the Noise, the NOISE!

'Ahem,' coughed the person behind Nasser, gesturing over to the bank teller sporting a green light. Nasser approached the window, duffel bag in hand.

'Good afternoon. Welcome to Lebanon Regional Bank. Please slide your identification under the window.' Nasser did as ordered. 'Please swipe your debit card.' Nasser continued. 'Please enter your PIN.' He entered his daughter's birthday. 'Thank you, Nasser, for providing verification. Your balance is \$200,000. How can I assist you today?'

'I'd like to please make a withdrawal request of \$50,000.'

'I'm sorry, but I am unable to process your request,' the bank teller continued robotically. 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today?'

Nasser's palms started to sweat. 'I'm sorry, but you must have misheard me. I'd like to please make a withdrawal request of \$50,000.'

'I'm sorry, but I am unable to process your request. Is there anything---'

'No, I need you to process my request!' he slammed his fist against the counter. The hairs stood up on the back of his neck. 'My daughter's wedding is next weekend, and I need to pay the vendors in cash. I was doing cash deposits to save for this wedding, and now the full amount is due. I've been coming for the past several months asking to speak with the bank manager and writing letters to your corporate office, trying to make this withdrawal in preparation for the event, but each time you've told me to try again later since my account is frozen.' Nasser poked his finger against the bulletproof window. 'Why is it frozen? You said it yourself: my bank balance is over two hundred thousand dollars. Why can't I withdraw a fraction of my savings?'

'I'm sorry, but due to a sudden shift in market conditions, all accounts are frozen and we cannot process any withdrawals at this time.'

Nasser drew the pistol out from his waistband, rocked the slide, chambered a bullet, and tapped the barrel against the glass. 'I'm sorry, but you will process my withdrawal request. Your MARKET CONDITIONS will not get between ME and MY MONEY!'

Silence.

Then, the mundane sounds of a humdrum office resumed: printers printing, staplers stapling, scanners scanning, phones ringing.

I've brandished a gun, but these drones just keep humming?

Nasser scanned the faces of the other eight bank tellers --- not a single one had turned to look at him. Their cozy bulletproof bubbles insulated them from the distress of his world.

Even if they cannot feel pain, surely they can empathize with pain in others?

He heard tapping once again, but this time it wasn't coming from him. The foot of the man standing behind him in line tapped harder as its owner cleared his throat with impatience. Nasser looked back in disbelief. The man was gesturing at his wrist as if Nasser was wasting his time. Not only did Nasser get no sympathy from the bank; his fellow bank patrons gave him no pity either.

So it comes to this.

He took a step back from the window as he holstered his pistol, and then reached into his duffel bag, pulling out his can of petrol. As he fumbled to unscrew the cap, he thought of his daughter's wishes before he left his house this morning.

I'm sorry, princess.

He closed his eyes as the petrol washed over him. The noxious smell burned his nostrils. Splashes hit the corner of his mouth making him gag. Still, he wrested a strange sense of satisfaction from the horrified gasps that came from behind the bank tellers' glass. He threw the can as hard as he could at the glass: it bounced off, crashing onto the marble-tiled floor.

He reached into his other pocket for his matchbook, struck a match, and lifted the flame towards the little bit of hair he had left on his head.

'Ok! Ok. Here, we can give you \$20,000 of your dollars and deduct your bank balance to \$180,000. I'm sorry, but ever since the market changed, all we've been able to carry is twenty grand. It's the best we can do. Please, there's no need to set yourself on fire.'

Nasser smirked, pleased with himself, and waved away the match's flame in victory. It wasn't the amount he asked for, but it was the successful act of defiance he needed. He picked up the empty duffel bag and motioned to the teller to get the cash --- his cash. Today he would be bicycling home, soaked in petrol, but triumphant.

◆◆◆

Stumbling through the front door, Nasser's daughter greeted him, downtrodden. 'Father, I could smell you while you were still outside. You reek of petrol. What did you do?'

'I did what I had to, for you.' Nasser threw the duffel bag onto the table, and unzipped it, revealing the cash. 'I love you.'

His daughter burst into tears. 'If you really loved me, you would've never risked getting arrested and missing my wedding!' She ran upstairs to her room, slamming the door.

Nasser sighed as he went to the backyard. Instead of opening a sliding door to financial fallout, he found the sun still shining, birds chirping, and his future son-in-law holding a flash drive with a screen on it. Nasser held up his hand, as if he was about to explain himself.

'Before you say anything,' his future son-in-law interrupted, 'please hear me out. As a man, her father, the provider, I understand your passion. However, life doesn't have to be this way. I hold in my hand a device that helps me to hold my wealth, your daughter's wealth, and hopefully your grandchildren's wealth. You can store the power of your life force for generations to come in an asset that will not lose value over time, whose property rights are always in your control, never at the mercy of market conditions.'

As promised, Nasser didn't say anything, but after a deep sigh, he motioned with his hands for his future son-in-law to tell him of the fancy new-fangled financial technology he had resisted for far too long. Ok, what is this magic internet money you're always talking about?
