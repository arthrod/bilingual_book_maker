# Chapter 3: **How Gold Won the Commodity War**

Within any society that uses a form of commodity money, the prior chapters showcased how it is nature that controls the ledger. Nature sets the boundaries for how hard the money is to make, and thus how resistant it is to debasement. Among participants that are of relatively equal technological development, nobody can cheat the ledger. Everyone must expend similar types of work to create new units of the money.

However, when an industrialized society encounters a pre-industrialized society, the industrialized society effectively controls the ledger of the pre-industrialized society. They have the technological capability to dilute the commodity money that the pre-industrialized society uses, whereas the reverse isn't true. The understanding of this capability takes time to spread through the pre-industrialized society, which unfortunately gives the industrialized society time to exploit the pre-industrialized society for their valuable resources.

The success or failure of various commodity monies therefore has a natural filtering aspect to it, with less-scarce monies gradually falling out of existence and the most-scarce monies remaining in existence. As the various human groups of our world encountered each other over time, the number of commodity monies in usage dwindled down to just a few.

Saving wealth in a non-ideal form of money and being unable to properly measure or understand the supply growth of the money that you use, can have dire consequences individually or as a society. This problem unfortunately extends into physical banknotes and electronic ledger systems as well, and indeed is amplified by those technologies, and this problem is described later in this book. After thousands of years, two commodities beat all the others in terms of maintaining their monetary attributes across multiple geographies: gold and silver. Only they were able to retain a high enough stock-to-flow ratio to serve as money and maintain a monetary premium, despite civilizations constantly improving their technological capabilities throughout the world over the ages.[^51]

Humans figured out how to make or acquire basically all the beads, shells, stones, feathers, salt, furs, livestock, grains, and industrial metals we need with our improved tools, and so we reduced their stock-to-flow ratios and they all fell out of use as money. However, despite all our technological progress, we still can't reduce the stock-to-flow ratios of gold and silver by any meaningful degree --- except for rare instances in which the industrialized world found new unmined continents to draw from, or invented new techniques like the gold cyanide extraction process.[^52] Gold has maintained a stock-to-flow ratio of between 25x and 100x throughout modern history, generally averaging around 50x or above, and briefly falling no lower than 16x during the Gold Rush in the mid-19th century[^53]. In other words, apart from the discovery of new continents or other one-time events, we historically can't increase the supply of gold by more than about 2% per year on a sustained basis, even when the price goes up more than tenfold in a decade like it did in the 1970s.[^54] Silver generally has a stock-to-flow ratio of 10x or more, which is still rather high.

Most other commodities have a stock-to-flow ratio that is below 1 or 2. Even the rarest elements, like platinum and rhodium, have rather low stock-to-flow ratios due to how rapidly they are consumed by industry.

Humanity has gotten better at mining gold with new technologies, but it's inherently rare and we've already tapped into the easiest surface deposits. Only the deep and hard-to-reach deposits remain, which acts like an ongoing difficulty adjustment against our technological progress. One day we might eventually break this cycle with drone-based asteroid mining or deep-sea mining or some similar science fiction level of technology, but until that day comes, gold retains its high stock-to-flow ratio. Those environments are so inhospitable that the expense to acquire gold there would likely be extremely high.

Basically, whenever any commodity money encountered gold and silver in the competition for money, it was always gold and silver that won. Other commodities could remain money for periods of time in specific regions, but gold and silver demonstrated the ability to compete globally as money and win each time. This is because whenever civilizations and monies would encounter each other, the holders of gold and silver had enough technological capability to devalue other forms of money, but the holders of shells, beads, livestock, salt, fabrics, and lesser metals could not devalue gold and silver.

**Precious Metal Coinage**

Authorities further enhanced gold and silver as money by creating standard units, generally in the form of coins. The minting of precious metal coins emerged in many regions, with Lydia (present-day TÃ¼rkiye) being one of the earliest known civilizations to produce them, back in the 6th century B.C.

The advantage of coins issued by some widely recognized authority (which at the time would typically be a kingdom or empire) is that they can standardize units in terms of size, weight, and fineness, which makes commerce easier to settle. Arbitrary amounts of gold and silver would have to be weighed so that the metal could be used in individual transactions, whereas standardized unit sizes remove that step from the transaction process. The face of an emperor stamped on the coin, perhaps also with ridges along the edges to prevent shaving of the metal, adds a degree of verifiability regarding the quality and content of the coin. Even to this day, if you buy modern sovereign gold coins such as American Eagles, you'll have to pay a premium for them per ounce relative to a bigger chunk of gold, and people do so because they know they are getting real gold and they know they can easily sell them in the future.

Furthermore, a kingdom would typically assign legal tender status to such coins, and they would trade somewhat above their pure metal content and above the value of similar foreign coins in their jurisdiction due to having this assured acceptance and liquidity. In other words, we can think of legal tender precious metal coins as having three layers of value. The first layer of value is the content of the precious metal itself. The second layer of value is the verification and convenience premium that coinage provides compared to raw bits of metal, which applies to both domestic and foreign coins to varying degrees. The third layer of value is a liquidity premium that only domestic coins have due to their wide (and often mandated) acceptance and recognition by merchants in the jurisdiction as legal tender. Wages and prices denominated in coined units tended to be somewhat "sticky," meaning that they took some time to change throughout society even if the supply of precious metals or coin supply varied within a short period of time.

These layers of value were repeatedly abused over the ages. Governments, finding their budgets unable to balance due to war or greed or mismanagement would eventually give in to the temptation of debasement. For example, a king can collect 1,000 pure gold coins in taxes, melt them down and make new coins that are each 90% gold (with the other 10% being made from some cheap filler metal), and spend 1,111 gold coins back into the economy with the same total amount of gold. They look rather unchanged to most people; wages and prices are rather slow to change; and the king may even force them to be accepted at their prior unit of account, such as by determining the unit in which he pays his soldiers. Years later, if the king still has deficits, he could re-melt his incoming tax revenue and make them 80% gold and spend 1,250 of them back into the economy. And if that's still not enough, he (or his successors) could reduce them to 70% gold, and so forth.

At first, these slightly debased 90% gold coins would often be accepted for the face value that they previously had, especially if enforced through legal decree. This is because the unit itself is partially abstracted from the underlying metal.[^55] As the coins circulated for longer and in greater numbers due to dilution, it would become obvious and much harder to enforce their prior value. Prices would go up and peoples' wages and savings would decline in value, as they pay taxes from their savings of purer money and earn their ongoing income in this newly debased money. Wages would push higher over time as people needed more coins to pay their expenses. Merchants would try to hold the purest gold coins and sell the diluted gold coins, and thus the fungibility of the whole monetary base would weaken, since coins would no longer be standardized at this point. Foreign merchants, outside of the jurisdiction of the government that mints the coins, would be quick to demand higher prices in these debased gold coins in exchange for their goods and services, valuing them more strictly for their metal content. The purest coins would eventually go out of circulation, from a combination of the king re-collecting them from taxes, from people hoarding them, or from foreign merchants taking them out of the jurisdiction.

Debasing coinage like this typically took years and decades. The silver Roman denarius, for example, was introduced as a small silver coin of over 95% purity in 211 B.C. It was then reduced in size and still over 95% silver. Briefly under the reign of Tiberius it was increased in purity, but by around 64 A.D. it further decreased in size and was less than 94% silver. It then remained at the same size for centuries but gradually declined in purity a few percentage points here and there. By the end it began to fall rapidly and was only around 5% silver by the year 274. Various wages, including government-paid wages, would not immediately change to take into account the slightly debased denarius each time, and so the emperor could get more value for his silver when initiating a devaluation.[^56] Over time, with more supply of coins on the market, prices would eventually push upwards, and soldiers would demand higher wages.

Eventually throughout the world, improvements in banking, which are described later in this book, reduced the need for coins, and improved gold's limited divisibility. People could deposit their gold into banks and receive paper credit representing redeemable claims on that gold. Banks, knowing that not everyone would redeem their gold at once, went ahead and issued more claims than the gold they held, beginning the practice of fractional reserve banking.[^57] The banking system then consolidated into central banking over time in various countries, with nationwide slips of paper representing a claim to a certain amount of gold.[^58]

During that era from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, gold finally won out over silver in terms of usage as money. Silver lost some of its monetary premium and therefore devalued relative to gold, compared to the thousands of years prior.

In his book *Globalizing Capital: A History of the International Monetary System*, Barry Eichengreen explains why a gold standard won out over silver: it was mostly an accident. In 1717, England's Master of the Mint (who was none other than Sir Isaac Newton himself) set the official silver-to-gold ratio too low, according to Eichengreen.[^59] As a result, most silver coins went out of circulation and gold became the unquestioned coin of the realm.[^60] Then, with the United Kingdom rising to dominance as the strongest empire in the 19th century, the network effects of the gold standard, rather than the silver standard, spread around the world, with most countries putting their currencies on a gold standard. Countries that stuck to the silver standard for too long, such as India and China, saw their currency weaken as demand for silver dropped in North America and Europe.

On the other hand, Saifedean Ammous, in his book *The Bitcoin Standard*, emphasizes the improved divisibility of gold due to banking technology.[^61] As previously mentioned, gold scores equal or higher than silver in most of the attributes of money, except for divisibility. Silver is better than gold for divisibility, which made silver the more day-to-day money for thousands of years while gold was mostly used by kings, merchants, and religious orders. The technology of banking systems and paper banknotes in various denominations backed by gold improved gold's effective divisibility. And then, in addition to exchanging paper, people could eventually "send" money over telecommunication lines to other parts of the world, using banks and their ledgers as custodial intermediaries. This was the gold standard --- the backing of paper currencies and financial communication systems with gold. There was less reason to use silver at that point, with gold being the scarcer and more durable metal with a higher stock-to-flow ratio, and now basically just as divisible as silver thanks to this second-layer abstraction.

I think there is an element of truth in both explanations, although I consider the explanation of Ammous to be more complete, starting with a deeper axiom regarding the nature of money itself. Banknotes made gold more divisible and thus the harder money won out over time, but network effects from political decisions can impact the timing and specific geographic spread of these sorts of changes.

Even after both gold and silver were demonetized by the global banking system in the second half of the 20th century, gold held its newly retained monetary premium over silver as an ideal form of savings. Gold used to trade at a 10x to 16x multiple of silver's value for thousands of years in multiple different geographies.[^62] Over the past century, however, the gold-to-silver price ratio has averaged around 50. Silver structurally lost a lot of its historical monetary premium relative to gold shortly after the introduction and deployment of bank ledgers linked by intercontinental telecommunication systems in the 1860s, and I don't think that's a coincidence.

As gold and silver went out of use as a medium of exchange, silver's superior divisibility became nearly irrelevant. Gold's properties as a scarcer and more durable metal with a higher stock-to-flow ratio became the more relevant attributes for saving, and therefore gold likely absorbed some of silver's monetary premium. Central banks around the world still hold gold in their vaults, and many of them still buy more gold each year as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Holdings at that scale involve hundreds --- or even thousands --- of tons, and therefore gold's much denser value than silver comes in handy for these large and long-term savers. Therefore, although government-issued currency is no longer backed by a specific amount of gold, gold remains an indirect and important piece of the global monetary system as a central bank reserve asset. There is no better naturally occurring commodity to replace it.

If the best form of money has an inherent limitation --- such as gold's limited divisibility --- then it allows for multiple types of money to coexist. Bimetallic and even trimetallic standards were necessary for long stretches of time to fix gold\'s divisibility limitations. On the other hand, if the best form of money does not have a limitation, then the best money tends to become more dominant and crowd out all others. With neither gold or silver widely used as a medium of exchange anymore, but with both still being used as a long-term store of value, gold is the more attractive choice for most larger holders due to its better durability, higher stock-to-flow ratio, and more value per mass and volume.

To this day, both gold and silver maintain a significant degree of monetary recognition worldwide. While not widely accepted for payments, if I were to take some gold coins or gold jewelry with me to almost any country in the world, I could find a dealer or merchant to buy them from me in local currency at a reasonable market price, and usually without much difficulty. Physical gold in the form of coin, bar, or jewelry has remained one of the best ways people have available to them if they want to store value in a dense, liquid, and fungible bearer asset form with no counterparty risk.
